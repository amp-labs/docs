## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `{{BASE_URL}}`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for {{DISPLAY_NAME}}, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: {{NAME}}-integration
    displayName: My {{DISPLAY_NAME}} Integration
    provider: {{NAME}}
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with {{DISPLAY_NAME}}:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for the correct credentials.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct tokens, and manage their refreshes. Please note that this connector's base URL is `{{BASE_URL}}`.
