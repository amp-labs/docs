title: Overview

Ampersand currently supports webhook and Kinesis destinations. Destinations allow you to route data synced from SaaS instances via [Read Actions](/read-actions) or [Subscribe Actions](/subscribe-actions), and to receive real-time [Notifications](/notifications) about important lifecycle events in your projects.

## Add a destination to the Ampersand Dashboard

Go to the [Destinations page](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/destinations/new) in the Ampersand Dashboard to add a new Destination. You'll need to provide:
* **Destination name**: this is an alias for the destination that you can then refer to in the `amp.yaml` file.
* **URL**: this is the URL of your webhook destination. It must start with `https`. In the case of webhooks, you can easily create a temporary one using tools like [Hookdeck Console](https://console.hookdeck.com?provider=ampersand).

## Using destinations for data delivery

For read and subscribe actions, you can specify destinations for each object. You can either have one destination for each object or route multiple objects to the same destination. Here's what your `amp.yaml` file might look like if you had created 2 destinations in the Ampersand Dashboard, one named `accountWebhook` and one named `contactWebhook`.

```YAML YAML
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: readFromSalesforce
    displayName: Salesforce read
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          destination: accountWebhook
        - objectName: contact
          destination: contactWebhook
```

## Using destinations for notifications

Destinations can also be used to receive [notifications](/notifications) about important lifecycle events in your project, such as when customers install or update integrations, when backfills complete, or when sync issues occur. Notifications use a topic-based routing system where you connect event types to topics, and topics to destinations. See the [Notifications overview](/notifications) for complete setup instructions.

## Supported destinations

* [Webhook destinations](/destinations/webhooks)
* [Kinesis destinations](/destinations/kinesis)
