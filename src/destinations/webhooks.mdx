For more information on destinations, see the [Destinations](/destinations) page.

When new data is read from a SaaS instance via a [Read Action](/read-actions) or [Subscribe Action](/subscribe-actions), Ampersand sends a payload to your configured webhook.

## OpenAPI spec

Check out our [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/amp-labs/openapi/blob/main/webhook/webhook.yaml) for the full webhook message schema and more details on the data structure. You can use this to generate types for your language and easily parse the webhook message.

## Read action webhooks

For read actions, Ampersand attaches results to a webhook message in two ways:

1) **Inline**: In most cases, the result is directly included in the webhook's `result` field. If a read action returns a large number of records, you might receive multiple webhooks in quick succession, each delivering a subset of the data. Read more about [message frequency](#handling-the-message-frequency) here.
2) **URL**: If a single record in the result set is over 300KB, it becomes too big to be sent over a webhook. In this case, the result won't be included inline. Instead, the webhook message will contain a signed download URL in `resultInfo.downloadUrl`. **The URL expires after 15 minutes.**

`resultInfo.type` indicates how the result is attached to the message:

If type is `inline`, the full result is in the `result` field.
If type is `url`, you can fetch the full result by making a GET request to `resultInfo.downloadUrl`.

In both cases, `resultInfo.numRecords` tells you how many records are available in the result.

### Example webhook message (inline)

Here's a sample webhook message for a Salesforce Contact object:

```JavaScript JavaScript
{
  "action": "read",
  "consumerRef": "user-123",
  "consumerName": "John Doe",
  "groupRef": "xyz-company",
  "groupName": "XYZ Company",
  "installationId": "installation-id",
  "installationUpdateTime": "2024-12-07T00:20:36Z",
  "objectName": "Contact",
  "operationId": "operation-uuid",
  "operationTime": "2024-12-07T00:20:40Z",
  "projectId": "ampersand-project-id",
  "provider": "salesforce",
    // If there is a mapping for this object, rawObjectName contains the original provider API name.
  "rawObjectName": "Contact",
    // readType indicates the type of read operation:
    // - "backfill":  Initial backfill.
    // - "scheduled": Regular scheduled incremental read.
    // - "triggered": On-demand read triggered via API.
  "readType": "scheduled",
    // Only certain providers will have workspace available.
  "workspace": "salesforce-subdomain",
  "resultInfo": {
    "type": "inline",
    "numRecords": 2
  },
  "result": [
    {
      "fields": {
        "id": "001Dp00000P8QurIAF",
        "firstname": "Sally",
        "lastname": "Jones"
      },
      "mappedFields": {
        "pronoun": "she"
      },
      "raw": {
        "id": "001Dp00000P8QurIAF",
        "firstname": "Sally",
        "lastname": "Jones",
        "pronoun_custom_field": "she"
        // ... other fields for this record
      }
    },
    {
      "fields": {
        "id": "001Dp00000P9BusEIS",
        "firstname": "Taylor",
        "lastname": "Lao"
      },
      "mappedFields": {
        "pronoun": "they"
      },
      "raw": {
        "id": "001Dp00000P9BusEIS",
        "firstname": "Taylor",
        "lastname": "Lao",
        "pronoun_custom_field": "they"
        // ... other fields for this record
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example webhook message (URL)

```JavaScript JavaScript
{
  "action": "read",
  "projectId": "ampersand-project-id",
  "provider": "salesforce",
  "groupRef": "xyz-company",
  "groupName": "XYZ Company",
  "consumerRef": "user-123",
  "consumerName": "John Doe",
  "installationId": "installation-id",
  "installationUpdateTime": "2024-12-07T00:20:36Z",
  "objectName": "Contact",
  "rawObjectName": "Contact",
  "workspace": "salesforce-subdomain",
  "operationId": "operation-uuid",
  "operationTime": "2024-12-07T00:20:40Z",
  "readType": "backfill",
  "resultInfo": {
    "type": "url",
    "downloadUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/....",
    "numRecords": 1
  }
}
```
## Subscribe action webhooks

Subscribe action webhooks look very similar to read action webhooks with a few additional fields in each result entry:
- **subscribeEventType**: this is the normalized event type string, which can be: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `associationUpdate` (for HubSpot only).
- **providerEventType**: this is the raw event type string from the API provider.
- **rawEvent**: when available, this is the raw webhook event from the API provider.

Here is a sample message:

```JavaScript JavaScript
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "projectId": "948234676-4874-43a4-beea-fa8081d13a07",
    "provider": "salesforce",
    "groupRef": "webhook-demo-group-id",
    "groupName": "webhook-demo-group-name",
    "consumerRef": "user-123",
    "consumerName": "John Doe",
    "installationId": "0c9230e1c-8fbe-4b28-bf10-2beee8fbf4ce",
    "installationUpdateTime": "2025-04-10T23:00:52.618406Z",
    "objectName": "company",
    "rawObjectName": "account",
    "workspace": "my-salesforce-workspace",
    "result": [
        {
            "fields": {
                "annualrevenue": null,
                "id": "001Dp00000ZDgmxIAD",

                    "changeOrigin": "com/salesforce/api/soap/63.0;client=SfdcInternalAPI/",
                    "changeType": "UPDATE",

                        "Description",
                        "LastModifiedDate"

    ],
    "resultInfo": {
        "numRecords": 1,
        "type": "inline"
    }
}
```

## Handling webhook results

Here's some pseudo-code to illustrate how you can get parse result from a webhook:

```go go
// Generated from the OpenAPI spec
type WebhookMessage struct {
	Action string `json:"action"`
	GroupName string `json:"groupName"`
	GroupRef string `json:"groupRef"`
     ...
}

func handleWebhookEndpointMessage(message WebhookMessage) {
  // Assumes that you have already parsed the webhook message into the openapi.WebhookMessage type

  var results map[string]any

  switch message.ResultInfo.Type {
    case "url":
      // If result type is "url", download the data
      res, err := http.Get(message.ResultInfo.DownloadUrl)
      if err != nil {
        // handle error
      }

      results = parseBodyIntoMap(res.Body)
    case "inline":
      // If result type is "inline", data is directly in the message
      results = message.Result

    default:
      // This should not happen - contact us if it does!
  }

  fmt.Printf("Received %d records", message.ResultInfo.NumRecords)

  // Process results as needed
}
```

### Handling the payload size

The maximum size of a webhook payload Ampersand may send to your destination is **300 KB**. Most API gateways can handle this by default. If you implement your webhook using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Run Functions, they will also be able to handle this payload size without any additional configuration.

If you are using the Node.js framework [Express](https://expressjs.com) in your webhook receiver, and are using the [json middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.json) to parse request bodies, you will need to modify it to increase the maximum request body size.


```js
  const app = express();

  app.use([
    express.json({
      limit: "350kb", // Set the max to 350 KB to allow for some buffer.
    }),
  ]);
```

### Handling the message frequency

By default, Ampersand will send you at most 1000 webhook messages per second across all your destinations. If you wish the change this limit, please contact `support@withampersand.com`. Alternatively, you can set the delivery mode to [on request](/read-actions#on-request) to only get webhook messages when you request for them via an API call.

## Webhook signature verification

Every webhook message that Ampersand sends includes a cryptographic signature. This signature lets you confirm that the payload is both authentic and unchanged when it reaches your system.

Ampersand uses Svix to deliver webhooks to your destination, which is why the signature is sent in the `svix-signature` header. Each destination has its own unique secret, called the "webhook signing secret", which is used to generate the signature.

To verify a webhook, you will need to:

1. [Get the signing secret](#viewing-your-secret) for your destination from the Ampersand dashboard.
2. Use that secret with any of the Svix libraries to verify the `svix-signature` header and confirm the message is valid. You can find more information on how to do this [here](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how).

#### Viewing your secret

To find a destination's webhook signing secret, navigate to the destination in the Ampersand dashboard and click on **"Click here to view the secret"**.

1. Log in to the [Ampersand dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com) & navigate to **[Destinations](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/destinations)**.
2. Click on the destination you want to view the secret for.
3. Click on **"Click here to view the secret"**.

#### Rotating your secret

If you need to rotate your signing secret for security reasons, you can do so from the Ampersand dashboard.

1. Navigate to the **[Destinations](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/destinations)** section in the Ampersand dashboard & click on the destination you want to rotate the secret for.
2. Click on **"Click here to view the secret"**.
3. Click on **"Rotate secret"** to rotate the secret & confirm the rotation.
