title: Using Ampersand AI SDK with @mastra
---

[Mastra](https://mastra.ai) â€”   is a Typescript toolkit that offers agent workflows and eval tools so teams can turn prototypes into production-ready AI, fast

This is a simple example of how to use the AI SDK tools by Ampersand in an agent built with @mastra.

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { createRecordTool, updateRecordTool } from "@amp-labs/ai/mastra";


// Mastra Agent with Mastra tools
export const mastraToolsAgent: Agent = new Agent({
  name: "Mastra Tools Agent",
  instructions: "You can use tools defined in Mastra.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    createRecordTool,
    updateRecordTool,
  },
});
```
