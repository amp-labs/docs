The `Ampersand Command Line Interface (CLI)` enables you to deploy integrations and interact with the Ampersand platform.

## Installation

### Using Homebrew  
To install the CLI using Homebrew (macOS users):  

```bash
brew tap amp-labs/cli
brew update
brew install amp-labs/cli/cli
```

### For Other Systems

1. Visit [Ampersand CLI Releases](https://github.com/amp-labs/cli/releases).
2. Download the appropriate binary for your machine’s architecture.
3. Place the binary somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/bin`).

**Note:**  
To ensure the CLI is accessible from anywhere, the binary must be placed in a directory listed in your `PATH`. You can inspect your current `PATH` using the following commands:

- **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH

## Using the CLI

### Log into your Ampersand account

Ensure you have an Ampersand account. Create one on the [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/sign-up) if you don’t have it already.

To log into the CLI:

```
amp login
```

To log out:

```
amp logout
```

### Deploy Integrations

Once you have defined your integrations in an `amp.yaml` file, use the following commands to deploy:

```bash
amp login
amp deploy <folder_with_amp.yaml> --project=<id-or-name>
```

### View all Commands


To list all available commands and global flags:

```bash
amp help
```

**Note:** For detailed explanations of each command and its options, refer to the [Command Reference](https://docs.withampersand.com/cli/command-reference) section.


### Running in CI/CD Environments

If using the Ampersand CLI in a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions):

1. **Generate an API key** in the [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/api-keys).
2. Use the API key with the `key` flag.

```
amp list:integrations --key=<api-key> --project=<id-or-name>
```

Alternatively, you can set the API key as an environment variable:

```
export AMP_API_KEY=<api-key>
amp list:integrations --project=<id-or-name>
```

### Debug Mode

For more detailed output, run commands with the ``debug`` flag. 

```
amp login --debug
```
