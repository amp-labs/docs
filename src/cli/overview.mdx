The Ampersand Command Line Interface (CLI) enables you to deploy integrations and interact with the Ampersand platform.

## Installation

### For macOS using Homebrew

To install the CLI using Homebrew (macOS users):

```bash
brew tap amp-labs/cli
brew update
brew install amp-labs/cli/cli
```

### For Windows

1. Visit [Ampersand CLI Releases](https://github.com/amp-labs/cli/releases).
2. Download the appropriate binary for your machine’s architecture.
3. Extract the downloaded folder containing the `exe` file.
4. To use the CLI, open Command Prompt in the extracted folder:
   - Navigate to the folder in File Explorer
   - Click in the address bar
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter
5. Verify the installation by running:

   ```cmd
   amp
   ```

   This should display a list of commands or options available in the CLI, confirming that it is properly configured and ready for use.

6. To make the CLI accessible from anywhere, add the folder to your `PATH`:
   - Open the Start menu
   - Search for "Environment Variables"
   - Click "Edit the system environment variables"
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", select "Path" and click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the path to the folder containing the `exe` file
   - Click "OK" on all windows

### For other systems

1. Visit [Ampersand CLI Releases](https://github.com/amp-labs/cli/releases).
2. Download the appropriate binary for your machine’s architecture.
3. Place the binary somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/bin`).

**Note:**  
To ensure the CLI is accessible from anywhere, the binary must be placed in a directory listed in your `PATH`. You can inspect your current `PATH` using the following commands:

- **Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  echo $PATH
  ```

## Using the CLI

### Checking the version

To check the version and build information of your CLI, run:

```
amp version
```

### Log into your Ampersand account

Ensure you have an Ampersand account. Create one on the [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/sign-up) if you don't already have one.

To log into the CLI:

```
amp login
```

To log out:

```
amp logout
```

### Deploy integrations

Once you have defined your integrations in an `amp.yaml` file, use the following commands to deploy:

```bash
amp login
amp deploy <folder_with_amp.yaml> --project <id-or-name>
```

### View all commands

To list all available commands and global flags:

```bash
amp help
```

**Note:** For detailed explanations of each command and its options, refer to the [Command Reference](/cli/reference) section.

### Running in CI/CD Environments

If you are using the Ampersand CLI in a CI/CD system (e.g. GitHub Actions):

1. **Generate an API key** in the [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/api-keys).
2. Use the API key with the `key` flag.

```
amp list:integrations --key <api-key> --project <id-or-name>
```

Alternatively, you can set the API key as an environment variable:

```
export AMP_API_KEY=<api-key>
amp list:integrations --project <id-or-name>
```

### Debug mode

For more detailed output, run commands with the `debug` flag.

```
amp login --debug
```
