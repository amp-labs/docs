This section provides a detailed overview of the Ampersand CLI. It takes you through all the available commands, their usage, and options.

## Usage

The general syntax for using the Ampersand CLI is:

```
amp [command] [flags]
```

Where `[command]` is one of the available commands, and `[flags]` are optional parameters that modify the command's behavior.

## Global Flags

Global flags are options available for any Ampersand CLI command, allowing you to modify behavior or provide additional information consistently across all operations.

Here are the available global flags:

- `-d, --debug`: Enables debug logging mode (default: false). This flag is useful for troubleshooting as it provides more detailed output about the command's execution.

- `-h, --help`: Displays help information for the command. This can be used to get more details about a specific command's usage and options.

- `-k, --key string`: Specifies the Ampersand API key. This allows you to authenticate your CLI sessions using an API key instead of interactive login, which can be particularly useful in automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

- `-p, --project string`: Specifies the Ampersand project name or ID. Many commands require a project context, and this flag allows you to set it without needing to include it in each individual command.

You can use these flags by adding them after any command. For example:

```
amp list:integrations --debug --project my-project
```

This command would list integrations for the project "my-project" with debug logging enabled.

## **Authentication Commands**  

These commands allow you to manage your session with the Ampersand CLI. Use these to log in to your Ampersand account before the Integration Management and Resource commands, and to log out when you're done.

### login 

Logs into your Ampersand account via CLI. 

**Syntax:**

```bash
  amp login [flag]
```

**Example:**

```bash
  amp login
```

### logout

Logs out from your Ampersand account.  

**Syntax:**

```bash
  amp logout [--debug]
```

## Integration Management Commands

These commands are used to manage your integrations within Ampersand. They allow you to deploy changes to your integrations, delete integrations, and manage installations of integrations.

### deploy

Deploys changes to integrations by uploading and applying your integration configurations.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp deploy <folder_with_amp.yaml> --project=<id-or-name> [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:** 
- Requires a folder containing an `amp.yaml` file.
- Use this command when you've made changes to your integration and want to update it in Ampersand.

**Example:**

```bash
amp deploy ./my-integration --project=my-project
```

### delete:integration

Deletes a specific integration from your project.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp delete:integration <integration-id> [--project=<id-or-name>] [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:** 
- This action is irreversible. Use with caution.
- Removes the entire integration configuration from your project.

**Example:**

```bash
amp delete:integration abc123 --project=my-project
```

### delete:installation

Deletes a specific installation of an integration.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp delete:installation <installation-id> [--project=<id-or-name>] [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:** 
- This removes a specific installation of an integration, not the integration itself.
- Useful for managing multiple installations of the same integration.

**Example:**

```bash
amp delete:installation xyz789 --project=my-project
```

## Resource Commands

These commands help you view and manage various resources within your Ampersand projects. Use them to inspect available destinations, current installations, integrations, and projects associated with your account.

### list:destinations

Lists all available destinations for integrations in your project.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp list:destinations [--project=<id-or-name>] [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:**
- Useful for seeing where you can deploy your integrations.
- The output includes destination IDs and names.

**Example:**

```bash
amp list:destinations --project=my-project
```

### list:installations

Displays all current installations of integrations in your project.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp list:installations --project=<id-or-name> [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:**
- Helps in managing and tracking deployed integrations.
- Shows installation IDs, associated integration names, and their status.

**Example:**

```bash
amp list:installations --project=my-project
```

### list:integrations

Provides a list of all integrations in your specified project.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp list:integrations --project=<id-or-name> [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:**
- Useful for getting an overview of available integrations.
- Includes integration IDs, names, and current versions.

**Example:**

```bash
amp list:integrations --project=my-project
```

### list:projects

Displays all projects associated with your Ampersand account.

**Syntax:**

```bash
amp list:projects [--key=<api-key>] [--debug]
```

**Notes:**
- Helpful for managing multiple projects or selecting a project for other commands.
- Shows project IDs and names.

**Example:**

```bash
amp list:projects
```

## Utility Commands

These commands provide general functionality to help you use and understand the Ampersand CLI.

### help

```bash
amp help [command]
```

**Notes:**
- Use `amp help` for general help and `amp help [command]` for command-specific help.
- Provides detailed information about command usage and available options.

**Example:**

```bash

```

### version

Displays the version of the Ampersand CLI installed on your system.

**Syntax:**

```bash
