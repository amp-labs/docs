Ampersand notifications deliver real-time webhooks about important lifecycle changes in your project. They allow you to track when customers install, update, or delete integrations; when backfills complete; and when sync issues occur.

If you want to be notified when there are changes in your customer's SaaS instances, use [Subscribe Actions](/subscribe-actions).

## How notifications work

Notifications use two main components that give you fine-grained control over which events reach which webhooks:

1. **Notification Targets** → Your webhook endpoints where notifications are delivered
2. **Notification Topics** → Groups of events that can be routed to specific targets

<Note>
When you create a topic, you select which event types it should receive and which targets should receive notifications. Events are routed: Event → Topic → Target. This lets you send different event types to different webhooks or group multiple events to a single webhook.
</Note>

## Available events

Ampersand supports the following notification event types:

- **`installation.created`**: Fires when a customer installs your integration to their SaaS instance
- **`installation.updated`**: Fires when a customer modifies their integration configuration (e.g., changes field mappings)
- **`installation.deleted`**: Fires when a customer uninstalls your integration from their SaaS instance
- **`read.backfill.done`**: Fires when historical data sync completes so you know backfill data is ready to process
- **`read.schedule.paused`**: Fires when a scheduled data sync is paused, often due to authentication issues or other errors
- **`connection.created`**: Fires when a new OAuth connection is established with a SaaS provider

## Setting up notifications

There are two ways to set up notifications:

- **[Using the Dashboard](#set-up-via-dashboard)**: Visual interface for quick setup
- **[Using the API](#set-up-via-api)**: Programmatic setup for automation and integration

### Set up via Dashboard

1. **Create notification targets**
   - Go to [Notifications](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/notifications/)
   - Click **Manage Targets**
   - Click **New Target** and configure:
     - **Label**: A descriptive name (e.g., "production-alerts")
     - **Webhook URL**: Your webhook endpoint URL
   - Click **Create Target**

2. **Create notification topics**
   - Click **New Topic**
   - Configure your topic:
     - **Label**: A descriptive name (e.g., "installation-events")
     - **Event types**: Select the events this topic should receive
     - **Targets**: Select which webhook targets should receive notifications
   - Click **Create Topic**

### Set up via API

When using the API, you need to create routes explicitly to connect events to topics and topics to targets. The dashboard handles this automatically when you create a topic.

See the [API Reference](/reference/notification/create-a-notification-target) for complete endpoint documentation.

<Accordion title="1. Create a notification target">
```bash
POST https://api.withampersand.com/v1/projects/{projectIdOrName}/notifications/targets
{
  "label": "target-name",
  "type": "webhook",
  "provider": "svix",
  "metadata": {
    "url": "https://your-webhook.com"
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Create a notification topic">
```bash
POST https://api.withampersand.com/v1/projects/{projectIdOrName}/notifications/topics
{
  "label": "topic-name"
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Create event-topic routes">
**Event-Topic Routes** connect specific event types to topics. This determines which events are sent to each topic.

```bash
POST https://api.withampersand.com/v1/projects/{projectIdOrName}/notifications/event-topic-routes
{
  "notificationTopicId": "your-topic-id",
  "eventType": "installation.created"
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Create topic-target routes">
**Topic-Target Routes** connect topics to webhook targets. This determines which targets receive notifications for each topic.

```bash
POST https://api.withampersand.com/v1/projects/{projectIdOrName}/notifications/topic-target-routes
{
  "notificationTopicId": "your-topic-id",
  "notificationTargetId": "your-target-id"
}
```
</Accordion>
