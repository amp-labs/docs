Ampersand notifications deliver real-time webhooks about important lifecycle changes in your project. Track when customers install, update, or delete integrations, when backfills complete, and when sync issues occur.

## How notifications work

Notifications use four components that give you fine-grained control over which events reach which webhooks:

1. **Notification Targets** → Your webhook endpoints
2. **Notification Topics** → Group events with targets
3. **Event-Topic Routes** → Select which events go to each topic
4. **Topic-Target Routes** → Route topics to specific webhooks

<Note>
Events are routed: Event → Topic → Target. This lets you send different event types to different webhooks or group multiple events to a single webhook.
</Note>

## Available events

Ampersand supports the following notification event types:

- **`installation.created`**: Fires when a customer installs your integration to their SaaS instance
- **`installation.updated`**: Fires when a customer modifies their integration configuration (e.g., changes field mappings)
- **`installation.deleted`**: Fires when a customer uninstalls your integration from their SaaS instance
- **`read.backfill.done`**: Fires when historical data sync completes so you know backfill data is ready to process
- **`read.schedule.paused`**: Fires when a scheduled data sync is paused, often due to authentication issues or errors
- **`connection.created`**: Fires when a new OAuth connection is established with a SaaS provider

## Setting up notifications

There are two ways to set up notifications:

- **[Using the Dashboard](#setup-via-dashboard)**: Visual interface for quick setup
- **[Using the API](#setup-via-api)**: Programmatic setup for automation and integration

### Setup via Dashboard

1. **Create notification targets**
   - Go to [Notifications](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/notifications/)
   - Click **Manage Targets**
   - Click **New Target** and configure:
     - **Label**: A descriptive name (e.g., "production-alerts")
     - **Webhook URL**: Your webhook endpoint URL
   - Click **Create Target**

2. **Create notification topics**
   - Click **New Topic**
   - Configure your topic:
     - **Label**: A descriptive name (e.g., "installation-events")
     - **Event types**: Select the events this topic should receive
     - **Targets**: Select which webhook targets should receive notifications
   - Click **Create Topic**
