title: "Subscribe actions"
---

With Subscribe Actions, you'll receive near-instant webhooks as events occur in your customers' SaaS applications. This enables your application to quickly react to events such as record creation, deletion, and field updates.

<Note>
   Subscribe Actions are currently only supported for Salesforce, and requires a Salesforce admin to install the integration.
</Note>

## Define a subscription

To subscribe to an object, you need to specify:

- **objectName:** to indicate which object you'd like to subscribe to. This should match the name of the object in the official documentation for the SaaS API.
- **destination:** the name of the [destination](/destinations) that you've defined

You then need to specify the particular events you want to subscribe to. We support the following events:

- **createEvent**: triggers when a new record is created in the SaaS application.

- **updateEvent**: triggers when any existing record is modified. The `watchFieldsAuto: all` setting ensures that you subscribe to all field changes. In the future, you will be able to specify particular fields to subscribe to.

- **deleteEvent**: triggers when a record is removed from the system.

Here is an example `amp.yaml`:

```yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
 - name: subscribeToSalesforce
   provider: salesforce
   subscribe:
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
         createEvent:
            enabled: always
         updateEvent:
            enabled: always
            watchFieldsAuto: all
         deleteEvent:
            enabled: always
```

## Using subscribe actions and read actions together

By combining subscribe actions with [read actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), you can get a full picture of all the data in your customer's SaaS instance by. You can:
- Do a full backfill when the user first installs the integration to get historic data.
- Then get real-time updates about changes in their SaaS instance.

You can achieve this by defining a subscribe action and a read action for the same object, and omit the `schedule` field in the read action. Here is an example `amp.yaml` file:

```yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
 - name: readSalesforce
   provider: salesforce
   read:
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
          # Read all accounts when integration is installed.
          backfill:
            defaultPeriod:
              fullHistory: true
   subscribe:
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
         # Then subscribe to create, update and delete events.
         createEvent:
            enabled: always
         updateEvent:
            enabled: always
            watchFieldsAuto: all
         deleteEvent:
            enabled: always
```

## Receiving data

You will receive webhook messages about events happening in your customer's SaaS instance. These webhooks look very similar to the webhooks for read actions. [See Subscribe Action Webhook Results](/destinations/webhooks#subscribe-action-webhooks) for more information.
