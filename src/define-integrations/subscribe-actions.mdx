title: "Subscribe actions"
---

When you subscribe to an event through Ampersand, you receive real-time data updates as events occur in your customers' SaaS applications, unlike Read Actions that only fetch data on a scheduled basis. This lets you respond instantly to important events, making your systems faster and more efficient.

## Defining a Subscribe Action in the Manifest

To define a Subscribe Action, include the following fields in your manifest:

```yaml

subscribe:
  objects:
    - objectName: company 
      destination: accountSubscribeWebhook
      createEvent:
         enabled: true
      updateEvent:
         enabled: true
         watchFieldsAuto: all
      deleteEvent:
         enabled: true

```

For a full example of how to set up a webhook, see [Webhook Example](https://docs.withampersand.com/destinations/webhooks#subscribe-actions-webhook-results).


### Event Types

- **createEvent**: Triggers when a new record is created in the connected SaaS application. This event fires once at the moment of creation.

- **updateEvent**: Triggers when any existing record is modified. The watchFieldsAuto: all setting ensures notifications for changes to any field within the company object.

- **deleteEvent**: Triggers when a record is removed from the system, allowing your application to take appropriate action when data is deleted.

<Note>: 
    - Subscribe Actions are currently only supported for Salesforce integrations. Support for HubSpot is in private preview. If you're interested in using Subscribe Actions with HubSpot, please contact support@withampersand.com.
