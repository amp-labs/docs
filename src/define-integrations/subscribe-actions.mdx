title: "Subscribe actions"
---

With subscribe actions, you'll receive near-instant webhooks as events occur in your customers' SaaS applications. This enables your application to quickly react to events such as record creation, deletion, and field updates.

<Note>
  Subscribe actions are in beta.
  - They are currently only supported for Salesforce and HubSpot. 
  - For Salesforce, an admin needs to install the integration.
  - They do not produce Operations or Logs that can be viewed in the Ampersand dashboard.
</Note>

## Salesforce subscribe actions

To subscribe to an object in Salesforce, you currently need to also have a read action specified for the object. In addition, you need to specify:

- **objectName:** to indicate which object you'd like to subscribe to. This should match the name of the object in the official documentation for the SaaS API.
- **destination:** the name of the [destination](/destinations) that you've defined
- **inheritFieldsAndMapping:** for now, you must always set this to `true` to inherit the mapped and unmapped fields from the Read Action. Learn more in [Fields and mapping](#fields-and-mapping).

You then need to specify the particular events you want to subscribe to. We support the following events:

- **createEvent**: triggers when a new record is created in the SaaS application.

- **updateEvent**: triggers when any existing record is modified. The `watchFieldsAuto: all` setting ensures that you subscribe to all field changes. Also, you can list specific fields to watch in `requiredWatchFields`. **Note**: Only one of `requiredWatchFields` or `watchFieldsAuto` should be provided.

- **deleteEvent**: triggers when a record is removed from the system.

If you do not already have a Salesforce integration, follow the instructions in the [Salesforce provider guide](/provider-guides/salesforce) to get started.

### Specify backfill behavior

By combining subscribe actions with [read actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), you can get a full picture of all the data in your customer's SaaS instance. You can:
- Do a full backfill when the user first installs the integration to get historic data.
- Then, receive real-time updates about changes in their SaaS instance

Here is an example `amp.yaml`:

```yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
 - name: subscribeToSalesforce
   provider: salesforce
   subscribe:
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
         inheritFieldsAndMapping: true
         createEvent:
            enabled: always
         updateEvent:
            enabled: always
            watchFieldsAuto: all
         deleteEvent:
            enabled: always
   read: # Read action is required
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
         requiredFields:
            - fieldName: name
            - fieldName: billingcity
              mapToName: city
              mapToDisplayName: City
            - mapToName: country
              mapToDisplayName: Country
              prompt: Which field is the country for the account?
          # Optional: read all accounts when integration is installed.
         backfill:
            defaultPeriod:
              fullHistory: true
```

If you do not wish to do a backfill when the integration is first installed, you can omit the backfill block in the read action definition. Because there aren't any schedules or backfills defined, the read action won't actually do anything but its fields and mappings will be used by the subscribe action.

```yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
 - name: subscribeToSalesforce
   provider: salesforce
   subscribe:
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
         inheritFieldsAndMapping: true
         createEvent:
            enabled: always
         updateEvent:
            enabled: always
            watchFieldsAuto: all
         deleteEvent:
            enabled: always
   read: # Read action is required
      objects:
       - objectName: account 
         destination: myWebhook
         requiredFields:
            - fieldName: name
            - fieldName: billingcity
              mapToName: city
              mapToDisplayName: City
            - mapToName: country
              mapToDisplayName: Country
              prompt: Which field is the country for the account?
         # Omit schedule and backfill
```

## HubSpot Subscribe actions

<Note>
  HubSpot subscribe actions cannot notify you of changes to custom fields. There is a workaround that requires additional set up, please contact support@withampersand.com for details.
</Note>

To enable HubSpot subscribe actions, you will need to:
- Have a Read Action defined for the object. You can [specify backfill behavior](#specify-backfill-behavior) in the Read Action, to combine backfills with subscribe actions to get a full picture of your customer's HubSpot
- Make modifications to the HubSpot app

If you do not yet have a HubSpot app, follow the instructions in the [HubSpot provider guide](/provider-guides/hubspot#creating-a-hubspot-app) to create one. Here are the steps to modify the HubSpot app to enable subscribe actions:

1.  Login to your HubSpot account. 
2.  Go to the **Apps** section.
3.  Select your connected app.
5.  Click on **Webhooks**.
6.  Enter the Target URL:
  ```
    subscribe-webhook.withampersand.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/integrations/INTEGRATION_ID
  ```
  - Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Ampersand project ID, which can be found in the Dashboard's [General Settings page](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/settings).
  - Replace `INTEGRATION_ID` with your integration's ID, which can be found in the Dashboard's [Home page](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_).

7.  Click **Create Subscription**.
8.  Select object types, event types, and properties.
9.  Select the required checkboxes for all objects.
10. Click **Activate**.

## Fields and mapping

Your read action's set of fields and field mappings will apply to the subscribe action. When we deliver you the webhook, it will contain `fields` and `mappedFields` based on the fields and mapped fields from your read action. You can learn more in [Object and field mapping](/object-and-field-mapping). For the example above, this is what your webhook might look like:

```JS
{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "groupName": "Demo Group",
  "groupRef": "demo-group",
  "installationId": "692428b5-22b6-417d-9478-0375949223c0",

        "city": "San Francisco",
        "country": "USA"
      },

      },
      "rawEvent": {

        },
        "LastModifiedDate": "2025-03-21T12:06:52.000Z",
        "Name": "Account ABC"
      },
    }
  ],
  "resultInfo": {
    "numRecords": 1,
    "type": "inline"
  },
  "workspace": "customer-salesforce-subdomain"
}
```

## Receiving data

You will receive webhook messages about events happening in your customer's SaaS instance. These webhooks look very similar to the webhooks for read actions. See [Subscribe action webhooks](/destinations/webhooks#subscribe-action-webhooks) for more information.
