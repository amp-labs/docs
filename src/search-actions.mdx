title: "Search actions"

A search action allows you to search for records in your customer's SaaS instance by specifying filter criteria. The matching results are returned synchronously in the API response.

## Enabling search for an object

Search does not require a separate action type in the manifest. Instead, it uses the `read` action. An object is searchable as long as it is defined under `read` in your `amp.yaml` and is not disabled in the installation config. There are two ways to ensure an object is searchable:

### Option 1: Set `enabled: "always"` in the manifest

By setting `enabled: "always"` on an object, it will always be enabled for every installation, regardless of the installation config. This is useful when you want to guarantee that the object is always searchable.

```YAML YAML
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: readSalesforce
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contact
          enabled: "always"
```

### Option 2: Ensure the object is not disabled in the installation config

If you don't set `enabled: "always"` in the manifest, the object is searchable by default. However, the installation config must not set `disabled: true` for that object.

```YAML YAML
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: readSalesforce
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contact
```

With this manifest, search will work as long as the installation config does not disable the object. For example, the following installation config would **prevent** search from working:

```json
// This would disable search for the contact object — avoid this if you want search to work
{
  "read": {
    "objects": {
      "contact": {
        "disabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Execute a search

You can call the [search API](/reference/search/search-records) to search for records in a customer's SaaS instance. The results are returned synchronously in the API response.

## Full example

```yaml yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: readSalesforce
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          enabled: "always"

        - objectName: contact
          enabled: "always"
```
