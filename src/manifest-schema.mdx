## Introduction

An Ampersand manifest (`amp.yaml`) is a YAML configuration file that defines how your application integrates with various SaaS platforms through the Ampersand integration platform. The manifest follows a structured schema that enables you to specify:

- What data to read from external systems
- What data to write to external systems
- How to subscribe to events from external systems
- How to proxy API calls

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the Ampersand manifest schema, including detailed field descriptions and best practices.

<Tip>
**VSCode Extension for amp.yaml**

Install the [Ampersand Schema Validator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amp-labs.ampersand-schema-validator) extension for Visual Studio Code to get:
- Real-time validation and error detection
- Auto-completion for all manifest fields  
- Hover documentation with examples
- Quick fixes for common issues
- Template generation for various providers

This extension helps you write valid `amp.yaml` files faster and catch errors before deployment.
</Tip>

## Top-level structure

The Ampersand manifest starts with a top-level structure that specifies the schema version and a list of integrations:

```yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: integration1
    provider: provider1
    # ... integration 1 configuration
  - name: integration2
    provider: provider2
    # ... integration 2 configuration
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `specVersion` | String | Yes | The version of the manifest specification. Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Currently only `1.0.0` is supported. |
| `integrations` | Array | Yes | An array of [integration configurations](#integration-configuration). Each element defines a complete integration with a specific provider. |

<Note>
Notes
- Only one `specVersion` is allowed per manifest file.
- The `integrations` array must contain at least one integration configuration.
- Multiple integrations can reference the same provider with different configurations.
</Note>

## Integration Configuration

Each integration defines a connection to a specific provider (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot). This section contains the basic metadata about the integration:

```yaml
name: my-integration
displayName: My Integration
provider: salesforce
module: crm  # Optional: for providers with modules
read:
  ...
write:
  ...
proxy:
  ...
subscribe:
  ...
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | Yes | A unique identifier for this integration within your manifest. Use lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores only. Maximum length: 64 characters. |
| `displayName` | String | No | A human-readable name for this integration. This name is displayed in the UI and logs. If not provided, `name` is used. Maximum length: 100 characters. |
| `provider` | String | Yes | The provider/platform for this integration. Must be one of the [supported providers](/provider-guides/overview) (e.g., `salesforce`, `hubspot`, `intercom`). Case-sensitive. |
| `module` | String | No | Module within the provider (e.g., `crm` for HubSpot CRM). Only applicable for certain providers. |
| `read` | Object | No | The [read configuration](#read-configuration). See [Read Actions](/read-actions) for implementation details. |
| `write` | Object | No | The [write configuration](#write-configuration). See [Write Actions](/write-actions) for implementation details. |
| `proxy` | Object | No | The [proxy configuration](#proxy-configuration). See [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions) for implementation details. |
| `subscribe` | Object | No | The [subscribe configuration](#subscribe-configuration). See [Subscribe Actions](/subscribe-actions) for implementation details. |

<Note>
Naming Conventions

- `name`: Use descriptive, unique names that identify the purpose of the integration. Examples: `salesforce-contacts-sync`, `hubspot-crm-integration`, `github-issues-tracker`.
- `displayName`: Use proper capitalization and spacing for better readability in UIs. Examples: "Salesforce Contacts Sync", "HubSpot CRM Integration", "GitHub Issues Tracker".
</Note>

<Note>The `provider` field must match one of the [supported providers](https://github.com/amp-labs/connectors/tree/main/providers). See the [Provider Guides](/provider-guides/overview) for provider-specific configuration details.</Note>

## Read Configuration

The `read` section defines what data to read from the provider. This section is optional - if your integration only writes data, subscribes to events, or uses proxy, you can omit this section.
> Learn more about [Read Actions](/read-actions).

```yaml
read:
  objects:
    - objectName: contact
      destination: defaultWebhook
      schedule: "*/30 * * * *"
      requiredFields:
        - fieldName: firstname
        - fieldName: lastname
      optionalFields:
        - fieldName: phone
      backfill:
        defaultPeriod:
          fullHistory: true
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objects` | Array | Yes | An array of [objects to read](#read-object) from the provider. Each element defines a specific object type (e.g., contacts, leads) to read. |

<Note>
Read Considerations

- For complex integrations, consider combining read actions with [subscribe actions](#subscribe-configuration) to get both historical data and real-time updates.
- See [Read Actions documentation](/read-actions) for detailed implementation guidance.
</Note>

## Write Configuration

The `write` section defines what data can be written to the provider. This section is optional - if your integration only reads data, subscribes to events, or uses proxy, you can omit this section.
> Learn more about [Write Actions](/write-actions).

```yaml
write:
  objects:
    - objectName: contact
      inheritMapping: true
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objects` | Array | Yes | An array of [objects to write](#write-object) to the provider. Each element defines a specific object type (e.g., contacts, leads) that can be written to. |

<Note>
Write Considerations

- Not all objects that can be read can also be written to.
- Some providers have read-only objects or fields.
- When `inheritMapping: true` is set, field mappings defined in the read configuration will be used for writing, which simplifies configuration for bidirectional syncs.
- See [Write Actions documentation](/write-actions) for detailed implementation guidance.
</Note>

## Subscribe Configuration

The `subscribe` section defines how to subscribe to events from the provider. This section is optional - if your integration only reads or writes data or uses proxy, you can omit this section.
> Learn more about [Subscribe Actions](/subscribe-actions).

```yaml
subscribe:
  objects:
    - objectName: account
      destination: accountWebhook
      inheritFieldsAndMapping: true
      createEvent:
        enabled: always
      updateEvent:
        enabled: always
        watchFieldsAuto: all  # Alternatively, use requiredWatchFields
      deleteEvent:
        enabled: always
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objects` | Array | Yes | An array of [objects to subscribe](#subscribe-object) to. Each element defines a specific object type to receive events for. |

<Note>
Subscribe Considerations

- Currently, subscribe actions are only supported for Salesforce and HubSpot.
- You must also have a read action specified for the object you wish to subscribe to.
- Only one of `requiredWatchFields` or `watchFieldsAuto` should be provided for update events.
- See [Subscribe Actions documentation](/subscribe-actions) for detailed implementation guidance.
</Note>

## Proxy Configuration

The `proxy` section configures API call proxying. This allows direct access to the provider's API through Ampersand's proxy. This section is optional - if your integration only reads or writes data or subscribes to events, you can omit this section.
> Learn more about [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions).

```yaml
proxy:
  enabled: true
  useModule: false  # Optional: use module's base URL instead of provider's root
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Boolean | No | Whether proxy is enabled for this integration. Default: `false`. |
| `useModule` | Boolean | No | If `true`, uses the module's base URL for proxy actions instead of the provider's root base URL. Default: `false`. |

<Note>
Proxy Considerations

- Enabling proxy allows direct API calls to the provider through Ampersand.
- This is useful for operations not covered by the standard read/write/subscribe functionality.
- All proxy calls are authenticated using the integration's credentials.
- API rate limits of the provider still apply.
- Proxy requests may be logged by Ampersand for security and debugging purposes.
- See [Proxy Actions documentation](/proxy-actions) for implementation details.
</Note>

## Configuration Objects

### Read Object

Each object in the `objects` array defines a specific data type to read from the provider:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objectName` | String | Yes | The [name of the object](#object-name) to read (e.g., `contact`, `lead`, `account`). This must match an object type supported by the provider's API (see note below). Case-sensitive. |
| `destination` | String | Yes | The [webhook destination](#destination) for the read data. This determines where the data will be sent after it's read. Must match a webhook configured in your Ampersand account. See [Destinations](/destinations) for setup. |
| `schedule` | String | Yes | A [cron schedule](#schedule) for reading the data. Defines how frequently the data should be read. Uses standard cron syntax. Examples: `*/10 * * * *` (every 10 minutes), `0 0 * * *` (daily at midnight). |
| `enabled` | String | No | If set to `always`, the integration automatically installs upon user connection and skips the user field selection step. |
| `backfill` | Object | No | [Configuration for backfilling](#backfill) historical data. Defines how historical data should be loaded. See [backfill behavior](/read-actions#backfill-behavior) for details. |
| `delivery` | Object | No | [Configuration for delivery](#delivery) of the read data. Defines how the data will be delivered to the destination. See [delivery modes](/read-actions#on-request) for details. |
| `requiredFields` | Array | No | Fields that are always read for every customer. These fields will always be included in the data that's read. See [Field Configuration](#field) for more details. |
| `optionalFields` | Array | No | Optional fields that can be included. Customers can choose which of these fields to include. See [Field Configuration](#field) for more details. |
| `optionalFieldsAuto` | String | No | Set to `all` to automatically include all available fields. This can be used instead of explicitly listing optional fields. |
| `mapToName` | String | No | An optional name mapping for this object. Used to standardize object names across different providers. See [Object and Field Mapping](/object-and-field-mapping) for details. |
| `mapToDisplayName` | String | No | An optional display name mapping for this object. Used for UI display. |

<Note>
When configuring fields for a read object, keep these points in mind:

- You can combine `requiredFields` and `optionalFields` in the same object definition.
- For detailed options on configuring individual fields, see the [Field Configuration](#field) section.
- Learn more about [Object and Field Mapping](/object-and-field-mapping).
</Note>

### Write Object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objectName` | String | Yes | The [name of the object](#object-name) to write to. Must match an object type supported by the provider's API. Case-sensitive. |
| `inheritMapping` | Boolean | No | Whether to inherit mappings from read configuration. If `true`, field mappings defined in the read configuration will be used for writing. Default: `false`. |
| `valueDefaults` | Object | No | Configuration for default values when writing to this object. See [ValueDefaults](#default-values) and [Write Actions default values](/write-actions#default-values) for details. |

### Subscribe Object

Each object in the `objects` array defines a specific object type to subscribe to:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objectName` | String | Yes | The [name of the object](#object-name) to subscribe to. Must match an object type supported by the provider. Case-sensitive. |
| `destination` | String | Yes | The [webhook destination](#destination) for the event data. This determines where the event data will be sent. Must match a webhook configured in your Ampersand account. See [Destinations](/destinations) for setup. |
| `inheritFieldsAndMapping` | Boolean | Yes | Whether to inherit field mappings from read configuration. For Salesforce, this must be set to `true`. |
| `createEvent` | Object | No | Configuration for create events. See [Event Configuration](#event) below. |
| `updateEvent` | Object | No | Configuration for update events. See [Event Configuration](#event) below. |
| `deleteEvent` | Object | No | Configuration for delete events. See [Event Configuration](#event) below. |
| `associationChangeEvent` | Object | No | Configuration for association change events. |
| `otherEvents` | Array | No | Array of non-standard events to subscribe to (e.g., `object.merged`, `object.restored`). |

### Other Objects

#### Object Name

The `objectName` must match the API object name in the provider's system. Some common examples:

- Salesforce: `contact`, `lead`, `account`, `opportunity`
- HubSpot: `contacts`, `companies`, `deals`, `tickets`
- GitHub: `repos`, `issues`, `pulls`, `users`
- Intercom: `contacts`, `companies`, `conversations`, `teams`

See the [Provider Guides](/provider-guides/overview) for provider-specific object names.

#### Destination

The `destination` field must match a webhook configured in your Ampersand account. Common patterns include:

- Provider-specific webhooks: `salesforceWebhook`, `hubspotWebhook`, `intercomWebhook`
- Generic webhooks: `defaultWebhook`, `dataWebhook`, `analyticsWebhook`

> Learn more about [Destinations](/destinations) and [Webhook Destinations](/destinations/webhooks).

#### Schedule

The `schedule` field uses standard cron syntax with five fields:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌─────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌─────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Common patterns:
- `*/10 * * * *`: Every 10 minutes
- `*/30 * * * *`: Every 30 minutes
- `0 * * * *`: Every hour at minute 0
- `0 0 * * *`: Every day at midnight
- `0 12 * * *`: Every day at noon
- `0 0 * * 1`: Every Monday at midnight

<Note>
Scheduling Considerations

- Higher frequency (e.g., every 10 minutes) provides more up-to-date data but increases API usage.
- Lower frequency (e.g., daily) reduces API usage but data may be less current.
- Consider the provider's API rate limits when setting schedules.
- For less frequently updated data (e.g., user profiles), a lower frequency may be sufficient.
- For rapidly changing data (e.g., chat messages), a higher frequency is recommended.
</Note>

#### Backfill

The `backfill` section configures how historical data is loaded.
> Learn more about [backfill behavior](/read-actions#backfill-behavior):

```yaml
backfill:
  defaultPeriod:
    fullHistory: true
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `defaultPeriod` | Object | No | The default time period for backfilling. |
| `defaultPeriod.fullHistory` | Boolean | No | Whether to backfill the full history (`true`) or just recent data (`false`). Default: `false`. |
| `defaultPeriod.days` | Number | No | The number of days to backfill. Default: `0`. |

<Note>
Backfill Considerations

- Setting `fullHistory: true` may result in longer initial sync times, especially for large datasets.
- Some providers may have API rate limits that affect backfill performance.
- By default, if `backfill` is not specified, only recent data will be loaded.
- See [Read Actions backfill behavior](/read-actions#backfill-behavior) for detailed implementation guidance.
</Note>

#### Delivery

The `delivery` section configures how data is delivered to your webhook destination after it's read from the provider. This gives you control over the timing and volume of data you receive.
> Learn more about [delivery modes](/read-actions#on-request).

```yaml
delivery:
  mode: onRequest  # "auto" or "onRequest"
  pageSize: 100    # Only used with "onRequest" mode (range: 50-500)
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `mode` | String | No | The delivery mode. Valid values: `auto` (default) or `onRequest`. See [on-request delivery](/read-actions#on-request) for details. |
| `pageSize` | Number | No | The maximum number of records to include in each webhook payload when using `onRequest` mode. Range: 50-500. Default: 100. |

**Delivery Modes**

**Auto Mode**

In `auto` mode (the default when no mode is specified), Ampersand sends data to your destination immediately as it's read from the provider. This is ideal for real-time data processing:

```yaml
delivery:
  mode: auto
```

**OnRequest Mode**

In `onRequest` mode, Ampersand reads data according to the schedule but stores it until you explicitly request it. This gives you control over when you receive the data:

```yaml
delivery:
  mode: onRequest
  pageSize: 200  # Receive up to 200 records per webhook payload
```

With this mode, you can:
- Control the rate at which you process data
- Prevent overwhelming your systems during large data syncs
- Request data when your system is ready to process it

To receive stored data, you call the [deliver results API endpoint](/reference/read/deliver-results) with the number of pages you want to receive.

<Note>
Delivery Considerations

- If you don't specify a delivery mode, `auto` is used by default
- The `pageSize` parameter only applies to `onRequest` mode
- For `onRequest` mode, if you request more pages than are available, Ampersand will send all available data and then send new data as it becomes available until your requested number of pages is fulfilled
- Configuring a larger `pageSize` means fewer webhook calls but larger payload sizes
- For systems that process data in batches, `onRequest` mode often works better
- For real-time data processing, `auto` mode is generally preferred
- See [Read Actions delivery modes](/read-actions#on-request) for implementation details
</Note>

#### Field

Fields can be configured in two main ways - either using a simple `fieldName` reference or using a mapped field approach (`mapToName`, `mapToDisplayName`, `prompt`, `default`). This flexibility allows for both direct field references and more sophisticated field mapping options.
> Learn more about [Object and Field Mapping](/object-and-field-mapping) and [Dynamic Field Mappings](/object-and-field-mapping#dynamic-field-mappings).

**Simple Field Reference**

For straightforward field access where you directly reference a provider's field without renaming it:

```yaml
- fieldName: firstname
```

<Tip>
This approach is best when:
- The field name in the provider's API is already meaningful to your application
- You don't need to standardize field names across different providers
- No user configuration is needed for the field
</Tip>

**Field Mapping**

For more complex scenarios, you can use field mapping to standardize field names or prompt users for configuration.
> Learn more about [field mapping strategies](/object-and-field-mapping#field-mapping-strategies).

```yaml
# Predefined mapping (no user input required)
- fieldName: mobilephone
  mapToName: phone
  mapToDisplayName: Phone Number

# User-defined mapping (prompts user during setup)
- mapToName: priority
  mapToDisplayName: Priority Score
  prompt: Which field do you use to track the priority of a lead?
  default: priority_level  # Optional default value
```

<Tip>
Field mapping is useful when:
- You want to standardize field names across different providers
- Different customers use different field names for the same concept
- You need to provide user-friendly display names
- You want to prompt users to select the appropriate fields during setup

See [Dynamic Field Mappings](/object-and-field-mapping#dynamic-field-mappings) for implementation details.
</Tip>

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `fieldName` | String | Yes* | The name of the field in the provider's API. Must match a field available in the provider's API for the specified object. Case-sensitive. |
| `mapToName` | String | No* | An optional name mapping for this field. Used to standardize field names across different providers. |
| `mapToDisplayName` | String | No* | An optional display name mapping for this field. Used for UI display. |
| `prompt` | String | No* | An optional prompt to show when configuring this field. Helps users understand what the field is for. |
| `default` | String | No | An optional default field name to suggest when prompting users. Should only use standard fields as defaults. |

*Either `fieldName` or all of `mapToName`, `mapToDisplayName`, and `prompt` are required.

**Common Patterns and Best Practices**

1. **Direct Field Access**: Use simple `fieldName` references for standard, unchanging fields:
   ```yaml
   - fieldName: email
   - fieldName: firstname
   - fieldName: lastname
   ```

2. **Standardized Field Names**: Use `fieldName` with `mapToName` to standardize field names:
   ```yaml
   - fieldName: FirstName  # Salesforce
     mapToName: first_name
   - fieldName: firstname  # HubSpot
     mapToName: first_name
   ```

3. **User-Defined Mapping**: Use `mapToName` without `fieldName` when users need to select the field:
   ```yaml
   - mapToName: notes
     mapToDisplayName: Contact Notes
     prompt: Select the field where you store notes about your contacts
   ```

4. **Combined Approach**: For complex integrations, combine these patterns:
   ```yaml
   requiredFields:
     - fieldName: email  # Direct field access
     - fieldName: firstname
       mapToName: first_name  # Standardized name
   optionalFields:
     - mapToName: lead_source  # User-defined mapping
       mapToDisplayName: Lead Source
       prompt: Which field tracks where this lead came from?
   ```

> Learn more about [Object and Field Mapping](/object-and-field-mapping).

#### Default Values

The default values or `valueDefaults` section configures how default values are handled when writing to an object.
> Learn more about [Write Actions default values](/write-actions#default-values).

```yaml
- objectName: contact
  inheritMapping: true
  valueDefaults:
    allowAnyFields: true
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `allowAnyFields` | Boolean | No | If `true`, users can set default values for any field during installation through the UI. Default: `false`. |

<Note>
Default Values Considerations

- Default values are applied when a field is missing from the write request
- When `allowAnyFields` is set to `true`, users can configure default values for any field through the Ampersand UI
- Default values can be different for each customer installation
- Default values must be configured for each customer via the [Create Installation API](/reference/installation/create-a-new-installation) or through the UI
- See the [Write Actions documentation](/write-actions#default-values) for implementation details
</Note>

#### Event

Each event type can be configured with specific options:

**1. Create Event Configuration**

The `createEvent` configuration specifies how to handle create events:

```yaml
createEvent:
  enabled: always
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | String | Yes | Whether to enable create events. Currently, only `always` is supported. |

**2. Update Event Configuration**

The `updateEvent` configuration specifies how to handle update events:

```yaml
updateEvent:
  enabled: always
  watchFieldsAuto: all  # Options: "all" or "selected"
```

Or alternatively:

```yaml
updateEvent:
  enabled: always
  requiredWatchFields:  # Watch specific fields
    - name
    - email
    - phone
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | String | Yes | Whether to enable update events. Currently, only `always` is supported. |
| `watchFieldsAuto` | String | No* | `all` watches all fields for changes. `selected` watches only user-selected fields when `inheritFieldsAndMapping` is true. |
| `requiredWatchFields` | Array | No* | An array of field names to watch for changes. These can include mapped fields. |

<Note>Only one of `watchFieldsAuto` or `requiredWatchFields` should be specified.</Note>

**3. Delete Event Configuration**

The `deleteEvent` configuration specifies how to handle delete events:

```yaml
deleteEvent:
  enabled: always
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | String | Yes | Whether to enable delete events. Currently, only `always` is supported. |

**4. Association Change Event Configuration**

The `associationChangeEvent` configuration specifies how to handle association change events:

```yaml
associationChangeEvent:
  enabled: always
  includeFullRecords: true
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | String | Yes | Whether to enable association change events. Currently, only `always` is supported. |
| `includeFullRecords` | Boolean | No | Whether to include full records in the event payload. Default: `false`. |

**5. Other Events**

The `otherEvents` array allows you to subscribe to non-standard events specific to certain providers:

```yaml
otherEvents:
  - object.merged
  - object.restored
```

<Note>
Event Configuration Notes

- For Salesforce update events, you must specify either `watchFieldsAuto: all` or `requiredWatchFields` with specific fields to watch.
- Event delivery happens in near real-time, allowing your application to react quickly to changes.
- For HubSpot, you'll need to configure webhook subscriptions in your HubSpot app as described in the [Subscribe Actions documentation](/subscribe-actions#hubspot-subscribe-actions).
- HubSpot subscribe actions cannot notify you of changes to custom fields without additional setup.
- See [Subscribe Actions documentation](/subscribe-actions) for implementation details.
</Note>

<Tip>
Combine subscribe actions with read actions to get a complete picture of your customers' data:
- Use read actions with backfill to get initial historical data
- Use subscribe actions to get real-time updates going forward
- Learn more about [combining read and subscribe actions](/subscribe-actions#specify-backfill-behavior)
</Tip>
