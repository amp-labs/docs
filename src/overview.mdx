[Ampersand](https://www.withampersand.com/) is a declarative platform for SaaS builders who are creating product integrations. It allow you to:

* Read data from your customer's SaaS
* Write data to your customer's SaaS
* Coming soon: subscribe to events (creates, deletes, and field changes) in your customer's SaaS

Here's an overview of the Ampersand platform:

The key components include:

* **Manifest file:** an `amp.yaml` file, where you define all your integrations: API to connect to, objects and fields you want to read or write, and configuration options you'd like to expose to your customers.
* **Ampersand server:** a managed service that keeps track of each of your customerâ€™s configurations, and makes the appropriate API calls to your customer's SaaS, while optimizing for cost, handling retries and error message parsing.
* **Embeddable UI components** with Ampersand, you can embed set-up, configuration, and management UIs that allow your end users to customize and manage their integrations.
