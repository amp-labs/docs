title: MCP Server
---

Connect your agents to the 150+ connectors we offer at Ampersand via this multi-tenant MCP server. We expose the primitives we offer on the Ampersand platform as native tools here.

<Note>
  The Ampersand MCP server is in beta. It may change in non backwards-compatible ways. (Although we are very serious about semantic versioning.)
  
  If you have any feedback, please let us know [on Discord!](https://discord.gg/BWP4BpKHvf)

## Connect to the MCP server

Here is how you can connect to the Ampersand hosted MCP server from your AI agent or from another MCP client (such as Cursor or OpenAPI Responses API). If you wish to locally run the server, please see instructions in the [Github README](https://github.com/amp-labs/ai).

If your MCP client supports headers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@amp-labs/mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://mcp.withampersand.com/v1/sse?project=<AMPERSAND_PROJECT_ID>&integrationName=<AMPERSAND_INTEGRATION_NAME>&groupRef=<AMPERSAND_GROUP_REF>",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "<AMPERSAND_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your MCP client does not support headers, you can pass the API key in the query param:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@amp-labs/mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://mcp.withampersand.com/v1/sse?apiKey=<AMPERSAND_API_KEY>&project=<AMPERSAND_PROJECT_ID>&integrationName=<AMPERSAND_INTEGRATION_NAME>&groupRef=<AMPERSAND_GROUP_REF>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Available tools

The Ampersand MCP server exposes the same set of tools that are available in the [Ampersand AI SDK](/ai-sdk#available-tools).
