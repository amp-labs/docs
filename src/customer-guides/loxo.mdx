## Checklist before installing a Loxo integration

Before starting the installation, you need to collect a few metadata values from your Loxo account. The steps below explain where to find each required value.

### 1. Full Domain
     Log in to your Loxo account and check the URL in your browser’s address bar. It typically follows this pattern: `https://[your-domain-here]`.

### 2. Agency Slug
     Go to **Settings > General under Workspace**. In the **Agency Info** section, check the **Resume Forwarding Address**. The text before the '@' symbol is your **Agency Slug**.
