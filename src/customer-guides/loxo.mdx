## Checklist before installing a Loxo integration

Before beginning the installation, you’ll need to gather a few metadata values from your Loxo account. The steps below outline where to locate each of these values.

### 1. Full Domain

Log in to your Loxo account and check the URL in your browser’s address bar. It typically follows this pattern: `https://[your-domain-here]`.

### 2. Agency Slug

Go to **Settings > Workspace > General**. In the **Agency Info** section, check the **Resume Forwarding Address**. The text before the '@' symbol is your **Agency Slug**.
