Now your application is ready for **packaging and deployment**:
* Repeat the same steps as any normal [ECA packaging](/customer-guides/salesforce-eca#salesforce-dx-packaging).
* Note that there is no `ExtlClntAppOauthSettings` metadata available for download in this scenario.
* If you are new to **External Client Applications**, please follow the full [ECA Guide](/customer-guides/salesforce-eca).
