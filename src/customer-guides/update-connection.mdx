If the credentials you provided for an integration need to be updated, you can use the **Manage** tab in the UI component to update your connection.

## When to update a connection

Re-authentication for the connection may be required in the following scenarios:

- In the **Manage** tab, the **Status** of the connection is showing as "bad_credentials".
- Your integration isn't working.
- You need to switch to a different account.

## How to update a connection

1. Navigate to the **Manage** tab.

2. Under the **Update connection** section enter credentials as needed and click the **Next** button.

## If Manage tab isn't visible

If you do not see the **Manage** tab, it means that the app builder needs to update `@amp-labs/react` to v2.7+ in their code.
