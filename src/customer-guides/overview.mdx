Welcome to the Ampersand **Customer Guides** section!  

Customer guides are specifically designed for end users who are setting up or troubleshooting integrations built with Ampersand. While our Provider Guides are intended for developers building integrations, these guides focus on clear, step-by-step instructions for anyoneâ€”whether or not they have a technical background.

With the customer guides, we want to simplify the setup process for you. Each guide covers common setup steps, troubleshooting tips, and best practices to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience.

## What you'll find here

- Step-by-step instructions for common integration platforms
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues

- Visual aids including screenshots and GIFs to guide you through complex processes
