## Checklist Before Installing a HubSpot Integration

We recommend verifying the following requirements before installing the HubSpot integration to ensure a smooth setup.

### 1. Verify app marketplace permissions

To install and configure a HubSpot integration, your account must have the necessary permissions to access the App Marketplace. If you don't have these permissions, you will need to request them from your HubSpot administrator.

To check if you have App Marketplace permissions:

1. Log in to *HubSpot*.
2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Users & Teams**.
4. Find your user account and check for **App Marketplace Access** permissions.
5. If you do not have the required permission, ask your HubSpot admin to grant you access.

For more information, refer to [HubSpot's official documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account/how-to-set-up-user-permissions-in-hubspot).

### 2. Ensure you have a saleshub seat (If Access to Leads is Required)

If your integration requires access to Leads, you must have a Sales Hub seat in HubSpot. Without this, you may not be able to retrieve or manage lead data.

To check if you have a Sales Hub seat:

1. Log in to *HubSpot*.
2. Click on your profile picture and select **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Users & Teams**.
4. Locate your user account and check for **Sales Hub seat** assignment.
5. If you do not have a Sales Hub seat, ask your HubSpot administrator to assign one to you.
