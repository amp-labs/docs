## Checklist before installing a HubSpot integration

We recommend verifying the following requirements before installing the HubSpot integration to ensure a smooth setup.

### 1. Ensure you are a HubSpot Super Admin

You must be a **Super Admin** to install an app. This is a [HubSpot requirement](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/authentication/oauth/oauth-quickstart-guide).

### 2. Ensure you have a Sales Hub seat (if access to Leads is required)

If your integration requires access to Leads, you must have a Sales Hub seat in HubSpot. Without this, you may not be able to retrieve or manage lead data.

To check if you have a Sales Hub seat:

1. Log in to *HubSpot*.
2. Click on your profile picture and select **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Users & Teams**.
4. Locate your user account and check for **Sales Hub seat** assignment.
5. If you do not have a Sales Hub seat, ask your HubSpot administrator to assign one to you.
