## Checklist before installing a Zoho integration

Before you proceed with the Zoho integration, you need to have a Zoho account with the Zoho CRM application activated.

If you haven't already done so, follow these steps to activate Zoho CRM on your existing Zoho account.

### Sign Up for Zoho CRM

1.  Navigate to the [Zoho CRM signup page](https://www.zoho.com/crm/signup.html).
2.  Enter your **Full Name**. 
3.  Enter your **Work Email**. If this email is already associated with a Zoho account, you will be prompted to sign in.
4.  Enter your **Password**.
4.  Provide your phone number.
5.  Click **GET STARTED**.

> **Note:** Having a general Zoho account (e.g., for Zoho Mail or Writer) does not automatically grant you access to Zoho CRM. You must sign up for it explicitly.

The integration supports all available Zoho CRM editions: Free, Standard, Professional, Enterprise, Ultimate and CRM Plus.
Although some actions like creating custom fields are not supported with the free plan.
