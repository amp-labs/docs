## Checklist before installing a Salesforce integration

We recommend verifying the following requirements before installing the Salesforce integration:

### 1. Verify your Salesforce edition supports API access

Salesforce editions offer different levels of API access, which can affect Salesforce integrations in Ampersand.

Before setting up your Salesforce integrations, you must confirm whether your specific Salesforce edition includes API access. Some editions include full API access by default, while others may offer limited access or require additional purchases.

To evaluate if your Salesforce edition supports the necessary API access for this integration, please refer to [Salesforce's official documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=000385436&type=1) on API access by edition.

If your Salesforce edition does not include the required API access, contact your Salesforce account representative to upgrade your edition.

### 2. Configure token policy settings

Salesforce access tokens expire after a certain period. To ensure your integration continues working without interruption, you need to set your refresh token policy to **Refresh token is valid until revoked**.

Here's how to configure this setting in Salesforce:

1. Log in to *Salesforce*.
2. Go to **Setup**.
3. In the *Quick Find* box, search for **Connected Apps**.
4. Click on **Manage Connected Apps**.
5. Find and click on the name of the application you are integrating with.
6. Scroll down to the **OAuth Policies** section.
7. Look for **Refresh Token Policy**.
8. Under *IP Relaxation*, select **Relax IP restrictions**.
9. Make sure the refresh token policy is set to **Refresh token is valid until revoked**.

10.  Click **Save**.

### 3. Check API access control settings

Salesforce allows administrators to restrict which applications can access Salesforce data through APIs. You need to ensure that API access isn't limited to only specific connected apps.

To verify your API access control settings:

1. Log in to *Salesforce*.
2. Go to **Setup**.
3. In the *Quick Find* box, search for **Connected Apps OAuth Usage**.
4. Under the list of connected apps, find your app and click **Manage App Policies**.
5. In the *OAuth Policies* section, ensure the **Permitted Users** status is one of:
- *Admin approved users are pre-authorized* - only selected users can access.
- *All users may self-authorize* - all users can access the app.

If you need to modify these settings:

1. Click on **Install** next to your connected app.
2. In the **OAuth Usage and Policies** section, set the appropriate permissions level.
3. Click **Save**.

### 4. Ensure sufficient permissions for installing user

The user that installs the Salesforce integration should either be:
- a System Administrator
- or a user that has been assigned a User Profile with sufficient permissions, it is best to create a new custom User Profile for this purpose.

#### Create a custom User Profile

To create a new User Profile:
1. Log in to Salesforce.
2. Go to **Setup**.
3. In the **Quick Find** box, search for "Profiles".
4. Click on the **New** button.
5. Choose an existing profile to clone, we recommend *Standard User*. Please ensure that you clone a User Profile with the *Salesforce* User License. The *Salesforce Platform* User License is insufficient.

#### View and edit permissions for a User Profile

Follow the steps above to go to the **Profiles** page, and then:
1. Select the User Profile you'd like to view and edit.
2. Click **Edit** at the top of the page.

3. Ensure the checkboxes for the necessary permissions below are checked.
4. Click **Save** at the top or bottom of the page.

Ensure that the following permissions are checked in the User Profile:
1. `API Enabled`
2. One of the following:
  * `Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps`
    * Choose this if [API Access Control](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.security_api_access_control_about.htm&type=5) isn't enabled.    
  * `Use Any API Client`
    * Choose this if [API Access Control](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.security_api_access_control_about.htm&type=5) is enabled. This can be enabled by contacting Salesforce Customer Support.
3. If your integration is using Subscribe actions:
  * `View Setup and Configuration`
  * `View Roles and Role Hierarchy`
  * `Manage Custom Permissions`
  * `Customize Application`
  * `Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions`
  * `Allows Users to Modify Named Credentials and External Credentials`
