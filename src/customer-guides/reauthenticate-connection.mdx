## When to re-authenticate

You may need to re-authenticate your connection in the following scenarios:

- Your OAuth token has expired
- The provider has revoked access to your app
- You need to update the scopes or permissions
- You want to switch to a different account
- The connection is showing as "disconnected" in your application
