If the user's connection to a provider app has expired or needs to be re-authenticated, the user can use the **Manage** tab in the `<InstallIntegration/>` component (`@amp-labs/react v2.7+`) to refresh the connection. 

## When to re-authenticate

Re-authentication for the connection may be required in the following scenarios:

- Your OAuth token has expired
- The provider has revoked access to your app
- Updating the scopes or permissions are needed
- Switching to a different account
- The connection is showing as "disconnected" in your application

## Re-authentication flow

1. Navigate to the **Manage** tab in `<InstallIntegration/>`

note: authentication flows will vary per provider.
