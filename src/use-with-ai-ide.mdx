Build production-grade product integrations faster with AI x Ampersand.

The official Ampersand docs MCP (Model Context Protocol) server helps you map your business context to the integration you need to build. It provides access to the full Ampersand documentation context, directly within your favorite AI-powered IDE like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com), or non-IDE clients that support MCP, such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).

Simply describe your integration use case to your IDE, and it will guide you through building it using Ampersand's powerful platform.  

## How it works 

Once you've added the MCP server, you can ask how-to questions or request your AI IDE to build an integration for you. Be as creative and descriptive as you'd like - your IDE will handle the rest.

### Sample prompts

### Tips for better prompts

- Mention Ampersand in your prompt. For example, "How do I do X with Ampersand?"

- Ask your IDE or chat client to verify field names against the provider's documentation. For example, "Verify that the field names are real field names for the Account object, according to Salesforce documentation."
