## What is a Unified API?

A unified API provides a single, consistent interface to interact with multiple third-party services. Instead of learning each provider's unique schema, you define one schema that works across all of them.

<Note>
Unlike traditional unified API providers that force you into their predefined models, Ampersand lets you design your own unified schema while providing templates to get started quickly.
</Note>

## Why Build a Unified API?

- **Faster integration development** - Add new providers without changing your application logic
- **Consistent data model** - Your application works with one schema regardless of the source
- **Gradual migration** - Start with compatibility mode, customize as needed
- **No vendor lock-in** - You control the schema, not limited by lowest common denominator

## Core Concepts

### Object Mapping
Map different provider objects to a unified name:

```yaml
# Salesforce Account → company
# HubSpot companies → company  
# Pipedrive organizations → company

- objectName: Account        # Salesforce
  mapToName: company
- objectName: companies      # HubSpot
  mapToName: company
- objectName: organizations  # Pipedrive
  mapToName: company
```

### Field Standardization
Create consistent field names across providers:

```yaml
# Different providers, same unified fields
requiredFields:
  - fieldName: Name           # Salesforce
    mapToName: company_name
  - fieldName: name           # HubSpot
    mapToName: company_name
  - fieldName: Account_Name   # Zoho
    mapToName: company_name
```

### Provider-Specific Access
Keep unique fields available without compromising the unified model:

```yaml
# Unified fields + provider-specific
requiredFields:
  - fieldName: Name
    mapToName: company_name
  # Salesforce-specific fields remain accessible
  - fieldName: AccountNumber
  - fieldName: Type
  - fieldName: SLA__c  # Custom fields too
```

## Examples

### CRM Unified API

Create a unified CRM that works across Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, and more:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Salesforce
- objectName: Account
  mapToName: company
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: Id
      mapToName: id
    - fieldName: Name
      mapToName: name
    - fieldName: Website
      mapToName: website
```

```yaml HubSpot
- objectName: companies
  mapToName: company
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: id
      mapToName: id
    - fieldName: name
      mapToName: name
    - fieldName: domain
      mapToName: website
```

```yaml Zoho CRM
- objectName: Accounts
  mapToName: company
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: id
      mapToName: id
    - fieldName: Account_Name
      mapToName: name
    - fieldName: Website
      mapToName: website
```

```Dynamics 365
- objectName: accounts
  mapToName: company
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: accountid
      mapToName: id
    - fieldName: name
      mapToName: name
    - fieldName: websiteurl
      mapToName: website
```

```yaml Result
{
  "object": "company",
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "website": "acme.com"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ticketing Unified API

Standardize tickets across Jira, Linear, Zendesk, and ServiceNow:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Jira
- objectName: issue
  mapToName: ticket
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: summary
      mapToName: title
    - fieldName: status
      mapToName: status
```

```yaml Linear
- objectName: issues
  mapToName: ticket
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: title
      mapToName: title
    - fieldName: state
      mapToName: status
```

```yaml Zendesk
- objectName: tickets
  mapToName: ticket
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: subject
      mapToName: title
    - fieldName: status
      mapToName: status
```

```yaml Result
{
  "object": "ticket",
  "data": {
    "title": "Ticket 1",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Migration from merge.dev

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Compatible Templates">
    Start with our merge.dev-compatible templates:
    ```bash
    # CRM template (matches merge.dev's model)
    amp deploy samples/unifiedCRM
    
    # Ticketing template
    amp deploy samples/unifiedTicketing
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Your Code">
    Replace merge.dev SDK calls:
    ```javascript
    // merge.dev
    const contacts = await merge.crm.contacts.list()
    
    // Ampersand
    const contacts = await ampersand.read('contact')
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize Gradually">
    Add provider-specific fields as needed:
    ```yaml
    # Start with merge compatibility
    - fieldName: Name
      mapToName: name
    # Add custom fields later
    - fieldName: CustomScore__c
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comparison with merge.dev

| Feature | merge.dev | Ampersand |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Schema Control** | Fixed common model | You define the schema |
| **Custom Fields** | Via remote_data | Direct access |
| **Provider Coverage** | Limited to common fields | All fields available |
| **Deployment** | One size fits all | Deploy per provider |
| **Data Delivery** | Pull only | Push (webhooks) + Pull |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with core fields">
    Begin with fields that exist across all your target providers, then add provider-specific fields as needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming">
    Establish naming conventions early (e.g., `snake_case` for unified fields).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document your schema">
    Maintain a schema reference for your team showing how each provider maps to your unified model.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle missing fields gracefully">
    Use optional fields for data that might not exist in all providers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
