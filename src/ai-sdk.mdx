title: Ampersand AI SDK
---

The [Ampersand AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amp-labs/ai) enables AI agents to seamlessly perform operations on connected SaaS tools through Ampersand's platform.

<Note>
  The Ampersand AI SDK is in beta. It may change in non backwards-compatible ways. (Although we are very serious about semantic versioning.)
  
  If you have any feedback, please file an issue [on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/ai/issues).
</Note>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @amp-labs/ai
# or
yarn add @amp-labs/ai
# or
pnpm add @amp-labs/ai
```

## Usage

The SDK provides several modules that can be used depending on your framework preference:

### Use with Vercel AI SDK

[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) by Vercel unifies LLM access in TypeScript & makes it easy to build AI agents. 

This is a simple example of how to use the AI SDK tools by Ampersand in a Vercel AI agent.

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateObject, generateText } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { createRecordTool, updateRecordTool } from "@amp-labs/ai/aisdk";

// Vercel Agent with AI SDK tools by Ampersand
async function handleCustomerQuery(query: string) {
  const model = openai('gpt-4o');

  const { text: response } = await generateText({
    model:
      classification.complexity === 'simple'
        ? openai('gpt-4o-mini')
        : openai('o3-mini'),
    system: '... your system prompt here',
    prompt: query,
    tools: {
      // AI SDK tools by Ampersand being used here
      createRecordTool,
      updateRecordTool,
    },
  });

  return { response };
}
```

### Use with Mastra

[Mastra](https://mastra.ai) is a Typescript toolkit that offers agent workflows and eval tools so teams can turn prototypes into production-ready AI agents.

This is a simple example of how to use the AI SDK tools by Ampersand in an agent built with Mastra.

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { createRecordTool, updateRecordTool } from "@amp-labs/ai/mastra";

// Mastra Agent with Mastra tools
export const mastraToolsAgent: Agent = new Agent({
  name: "Mastra Tools Agent",
  instructions: "You can use tools defined in Mastra.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    createRecordTool,
    updateRecordTool,
  },
});
```

## Available Tools

The SDK provides the following tools for interacting with SaaS platforms:

| Tool | Description | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `createRecordTool` | Creates a new record in the connected SaaS platform | Create new records like contacts, deals, tickets etc. |
| `updateRecordTool` | Updates an existing record in the connected SaaS platform | Modify existing records with new data |
| `sendReadRequestTool` | Makes authenticated GET API calls to the provider through Ampersand | Reading and searching records |
| `sendRequestTool` | Makes authenticated API calls to the provider through Ampersand | Do any action that is available via the API |
| `checkConnectionTool` | Verifies if there is an active connection to the SaaS provider | Validate connection status before creating an installation |
| `createInstallationTool` | Creates a new installation for a provider | Create an installation for an existing connection |
| `checkInstallationTool` | Checks if there is an active installation for a provider | Verify installation status |
| `startOAuthTool` | Returns URL for initiating OAuth flow for connecting to a provider | Authenticates a new user |
