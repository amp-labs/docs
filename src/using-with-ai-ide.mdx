## Introducing the official Ampersand docs server

Now you can build production-grade business integrations even faster with the power of AI x Ampersand.


-  The official MCP documentation (Model Context Protocol) server allows you as a developer to map your business context to the integration you need to build 
with all the context of the Ampersand offering from its documentation (`read`, `write` & `subscribe`) right inside your favorite AI IDE such as Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, etc.

-  Just tell Cursor what your integration use case is and the IDE will know how to build this with Ampersand's powerful platform quickly!  

## How it works 

Once you have added the MCP server, you can ask how-tos as well as ask your AI IDE to build an integration for you. You can be as creative and descriptive as you'd like, and Cursor will do the rest.

### Prompts you can use
