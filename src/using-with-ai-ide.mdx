title: "Introducing the official Ampersand docs server "
---


Now you can build production grade business integrations even faster with the power of AI x Ampersand. 


-  The offical mcp documentation server allows you as a developer to map your business context to the integration you need to build 
with all the context of the Ampersand offering from its documentation (`read`, `write` & `subscribe`) right inside your favourite AI IDE such Cursor, Windsurf, Cline et al. 

-  Just tell Cursor what your integration use-case is and the IDE will know how to build this with Ampersand's powerful platform quickly!  

## How it works 

Once you have added the mcp server, you can ask how-to's as well as ask your AI IDE to build an integration for you. You can be as creative and descriptive as you'd like, and Cursor will do the rest.

### Prompts you can use
