title: "Dev and prod environments"
---

You can create multiple projects per organization, so we recommend at least creating two projects:
- one for your production environment.
- one for your development environment, where you can test integrations before shipping them to customers.

You can deploy the same set of integrations to all of your projects by defining a single `amp.yaml` file. Then you can use the amp CLI to deploy it to all of your projects:

``` bash
amp login

# First deploy to dev
amp deploy my-integrations-folder --project=my-dev-project

# Promote to prod when you are ready
amp deploy my-integrations-folder --project=my-prod-project
```

Please note that for each of your projects, you will need to:
- Add Provider Apps to the Ampersand Dashboard. See [Provider Guides](/provider-guides/overview) for more details.
- Generate API keys for embedding UI components or for making API calls.
- Add [Destinations](/destinations) to the Ampersand Dashboard if you have any read actions.

## Destination names

You should use the same names for the webhook destinations in each of your projects. For example, `my-dev-project` can have a `hubspotWebhook` which has the URL `https://www.my-dev-webhook.com`, and `my-prod-project` can have a `hubspotWebhook` which has the URL `https://www.my-prod-webhook.com`. Then in my `amp.yaml` file, my integration will be defined as follows:

``` yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
  - name: readHubspotContacts
    provider: hubspot
    module: crm
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contact
          # In dev, webhook messages will go to `https://www.my-dev-webhook.com`,
          # In prod, they will go to `https://www.my-prod-webhook.com`.
          destination: hubspotWebhook
          ...
```
