For this Quickstart, we are going to build integrations for a cool new SaaS app called MailMonkey - an email campaign manager that integrates with Salesforce. You can see the final `amp.yaml` file on [Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/quickstart/amp.yaml).

## Create an Ampersand org and project

Sign up for an [Ampersand account](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/sign-up), and then follow the steps on the screen to create an org and then a project. Each org can have multiple projects, this is helpful for separating development and production environments.

## Create a provider app

We'll first set up a Salesforce Connected App and put the Client ID and Client Secret inside of Ampersand Dashboard. See the [Salesforce guide](/provider-guides/salesforce) for more information.

## Create a destination

Next, we create a webhook destination for Ampersand to send data that it reads from Salesforce. See [Destinations](destinations) for more details.

## Define the integrations

To make MailMonkey interoperate seamlessly with our customers' Salesforce, we will create an integration which will:

1. **Read Contacts and Leads**: pull all Contacts and Leads from a customer's Salesforce into MailMonkey.
2. **Create Leads**: create a new Lead in Salesforce whenever somebody replies to to a MailMonkey email campaign.

Let's create a folder called `source`, with a file inside called `amp.yaml`, this is where we will define our integration.

### Read Contacts and Leads

Our integration will have a [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions). We'll read 2 objects from Salesforce: contacts and leads.

```YAML YAML
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: mailmonkey-salesforce
    displayName: MailMonkey Salesforce Integration
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contact
          destination: contactWebhook
          schedule: "*/30 * * * *" # every 30 minutes
          # Always read these fields
          requiredFields:
            - fieldName: firstName
            - fieldName: lastName
            - fieldName: email
          # Customer can decide if they want us to read these fields.
          optionalFields:
            - fieldName: salutation
        - objectName: leads
          destination: leadsWebhook
          schedule: "*/30 * * * *" # every 30 minutes
          requiredFields:
            - fieldName: firstName
            - fieldName: lastName
            - fieldName: email
            - fieldName: isConverted
            # Allow the customer to pick a field to map to priority score
            - mapToName: priority
              mapToDisplayName: Priority Score
              prompt: Which field do you use to track the priority of a lead?
          # All other fields in a Lead are optional,
          # Customers can pick from all of them.
          optionalFieldsAuto: all
```

### Create Leads

Next we will add a [Write Action](/define-integrations/write-actions). We want to insert new leads into our customer's Salesforce.


```YAML YAML
...
    # Append to the integration definition from above.
    write
      objects:
        # Create a new lead in Salesforce whenever we make an API request.
        - objectName: lead
```

Once a customer installs our integration, MailMonkey's application backend will make an API call to Ampersand to create the new lead whenever there's an email reply that we detect.

### Deploy the completed manifest

You can see the final `amp.yaml` file on [Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/quickstart/amp.yaml). 

Once we are happy with the definition of our integrations, we can deploy them with the [amp CLI](/cli/overview):

```
amp login
# Our amp.yaml file is located in a folder called source.
amp deploy source --project=my-project-id-or-name
```

## Embed UI components

Next, we will use Ampersand's react library to embed ready-made UI components into our app, so that our customers can start using our shiny new integrations! We'll use the `InstallIntegration` component for the auth flow and configuration steps. Check out [Embed UI components](/embeddable-ui-components) for more details on this component and other components to help your users set up and manage their integrations. 

Here's a simplified version of what our frontend code would look like:


```TypeScript TypeScript
import { AmpersandProvider, InstallIntegration } from '@amp-labs/react';

const options = {
  project: 'my-project', // Your Ampersand project name or ID.
  apiKey: 'API_KEY',// Your Ampersand API key, created in the Dashboard.
};

function App() {
  return (
    <AmpersandProvider options={options}>
      <InstallIntegration 
        // The name of the integration from amp.yaml
        integration = "readContactsAndLeads"
        // The ID that your app uses to identify this end user.
        consumerRef = {userId}
        // The display name that your app uses for this end user.
        consumerName = {userName}
        // The ID that your app uses to identify the user's company, org, or team.
        groupRef = {groupId}
        // The display name that your app uses for this company, org or team.
        groupName = {groupName}
      />
    </AmpersandProvider>
  )
}
```
