### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Acuity Scheduling integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/acuityScheduling/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Acuity Scheduling with Ampersand, you will need [an Acuity Scheduling Account](https://acuityscheduling.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to register an Oauth app and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create an Acuity Scheduling Account

Here's how you can sign up for an Acuity Scheduling account:

- Go to the [Acuity Scheduling Sign Up page](https://login.squarespace.com/api/1/login/oauth/provider/authorize?client_id=aHW16IlRwTPNctfSvoofuCarXfdJDvJK&state=U2dzVitmZFBhVjd0aGJpekJHcFdkU0JoTHY4bnk5U3dGTHRNN3c2MlVidz06eyJ1IjowLCJ4IjoxNzIyNTA5MjA2LCJuIjoiZTZlYmVkZTcifQ%3D%3D&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.acuityscheduling.com%2Foauth2%2Fsquarespace-trial%2Fcallback&access_type=offline&action=form&type=professional&freeTrial=1&lite=1&btn=nav&action=form&type=professional&freeTrial=1&lite=1&btn=nav&overrideLocale=en-US&device_id=d000e6d3-e4b3-4e9a-b8f5-5136c400de1e&analytics_id=d000e6d3-e4b3-4e9a-b8f5-5136c400de1e&entry_point=acuity#/signup).

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Acuity Scheduling:
- Create a manifest file like the [example above](#example-integration).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for OAuth authorization.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
