- [Write Action](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Action](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://my.cloudtalk.io/api`.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate **CloudTalk** with **Ampersand**, you need your **Access Key ID** and **Access Key Secret**. To obtain these:

1. Log in to your [CloudTalk Dashboard](https://my.cloudtalk.io/login).
2. Navigate to **Account** > **Settings** > **API Keys**.
3. Click **Add API Key** to generate a new pair of credentials.

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with CloudTalk:

- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/cloudtalk/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their Access Key ID and Access Key Secret.
- Start using the connector!
  - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
  - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
  - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
