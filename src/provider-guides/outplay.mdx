## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:

- [Write Actions](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.workspace}}-api.outplayhq.com`.

The Outplay connector supports writing and reading from the following objects:
- [prospect](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16947449/TzsikPV1#21e32202-0bb8-411c-a46d-58da59313f49) (read, write)

<Note>
**Note:**
The `call` object requires incremental read to be configured. Without it, only records from the last 30 days will be read.

### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Outplay integration, visit our [samples repo on GitHub](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/outplay/amp.yaml).


## Before you get started

You'll need an Outplay account and API credentials to use this connector.

### Creating Outplay credentials
1. Log into your Outplay account.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Settings**.
3. Generate an API key if you haven't already.
4. Note your workspace identifier - this is the subdomain in your Outplay URL (e.g., if your Outplay URL is `https://mycompany-api.outplayhq.com`, your workspace is `mycompany`).

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Outplay:

- Create a manifest file like the [example above](#example-integration).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If using Read or Write actions: create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their API credentials and workspace location.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
