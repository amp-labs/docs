## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.site}}.chargebee.com/api`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Bird (MessageBird), create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: chargebee-integration
    displayName: My Chargebee Integration
    provider: chargebee
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Chargebee:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their username, password and site name.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct header required by Basic Auth. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://{{.site}}.chargebee.com/api`.

## Creating Basic Auth Credentials for Chargebee

Chargebee uses the API Key as the username when authenticating with Basic Auth. The password field should be left blank.
