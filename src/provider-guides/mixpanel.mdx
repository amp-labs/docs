## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{subdomain}.mixpanel.com`, where `{subdomain}` is the subdomain for a particular API.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Mixpanel with Ampersand, you will need [a Mixpanel Account](https://mixpanel.com).

### Example integration

To define an integration for Mixpanel, create a manifest file that looks like this:


```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: mixpanel-integration
    displayName: My mixpanel Integration
    provider: mixpanel
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```


## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Guru:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. This UI component will prompt the customer for their subdomain, username and password.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct header required by Basic Auth. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://{subdomain}.mixpanel.com`.

## Creating Basic Auth credentials

To begin using the API in your Mixpanel account, you need to create service account credentials:

- Navigate to Settings.
- Click on Organization Settings > Service Accounts.
- Click the Add Service Account button in the top right corner.
- Provide the required field details. Once done, your username and password for Basic Authentication will be displayed.
