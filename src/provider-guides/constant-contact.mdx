## Before You Get Started

To integrate Constant Contact with Ampersand, you must have a Constant Contact Developer account and obtain the necessary credentials.

Once your account is set up, you'll need to create an app in Constant Contact to get the following credentials:

- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

You will use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Constant Contact Account

Here's how to sign up for a Constant Contact account:

1. Go to the [Constant Contact Sign Up page](https://v3.developer.constantcontact.com/login/index.html?_ga=2.74994962.1095369080.1723052125-94b8f87f-e462-4b81-9771-2b211eac0567&_gac=1.89512297.1720021371.Cj0KCQjw7ZO0BhDYARIsAFttkCjWgg2zwOvaQdS8IlbZamQr4AT9C2j_7t1Xm6EFPKJSJ7W0PHnV6gQaAi1WEALw_wcB).
2. Sign up using your preferred method and follow the instructions to create your account.

### Creating a Constant Contact App

Follow these steps to create an app in Constant Contact and add the Ampersand redirect URL:

1. Log in to your [Constant Contact Developer Account](https://v3.developer.constantcontact.com/login).

2. Go to  **My Applications**.

3. Click the **New Application** button.

4. In the **New Application** dialog box, enter an **Application Name** for your app.

5. Select an **OAuth2 Flow**. 

6. Choose a **Refresh Token** type.

7. Click **Create**.




### Adding Ampersand Redirect URL in Your App

Once your app is created, you will be redirected to the **My Applications** page. Select your newly created application from the list and add the following details to your application to setup Oauth in your app. 

1. In the **Redirect URLs** section, click **Add another redirect URL**. 
2. Enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
3. Click **Confirm**.
4. You will find your _Client ID_ in the _API Key (Client ID)_ section. Click **Generate Client Secret** to create a _Client Secret_ key for your app. Be sure to note both the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_, as you will need these to connect your app to Ampersand.
