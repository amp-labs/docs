## Before you get started

To integrate ClickUp with Ampersand, you will need [a ClickUp Account](https://app.clickup.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in ClickUp and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a ClickUp Account

Here's how you can sign up for a ClickUp account:

- Go to the [ClickUp Sign Up page](https://app.clickup.com/signup) and create an account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating a ClickUp App

Follow the steps below to create a ClickUp app and add the Ampersand redirect URL in the app:

1. Log in to your [ClickUp](https://app.clickup.com/settings/apps) account.
2. Click **+Create an App**.
3. Enter your **App Name**.
4. Enter the Ampersand's **Redirect URL**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`. 
5. Click **Create App**.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Clickup:
- Create a manifest file using the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/clickup/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.

   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
