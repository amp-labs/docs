### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a CloseCRM integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/closecrm/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Close with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Close Account](#create-a-close-crm-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Close App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use this credential to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Close Account

You need a **Close** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a Close account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Close site](https://close.com/) and sign up for a free account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating an OAuth app in Close

Once your Close account is ready, you need to create an OAuth application to connect with Ampersand. Follow the steps below to create the OAuth app:

1.  Log in to Your [Close Account](https://app.close.com/login/).

2.  Go to **Settings**.

3.  On the _Settings_ page, click **Developer** under the **Connect** section.

4.  Go to the **OAuth Apps** tab.

5.  Click the **Create App** button.

6.  Enter the following details in the **Create OAuth App** form:

    1. **App Name**: The name of the OAuth app.
    2. **App Description**: Description for the OAuth app.
    3. **Redirect URL**: Enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`

7.  Click **Create**.

You'll find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys in your Oauth app details. These credentials are required for connecting your app to Ampersand, so be sure to note them carefully.
