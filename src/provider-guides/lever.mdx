## Before You Get Started

To connect Lever with Ampersand, you need [a Lever Account](https://www.lever.co/demo/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to contact the support team to enable the OAuth option, and you'll need to create an app in Lever and obtain the following credentials from your app:
