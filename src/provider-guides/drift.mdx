Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Drift, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

- Go to the [Drift Sign Up page](https://app.drift.com/signup).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
