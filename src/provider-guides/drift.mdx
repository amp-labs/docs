### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Apollo integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/drift/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Drift with Ampersand, you will need [a Drift Account](https://app.drift.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Drift, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Drift Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Drift account:

- Go to the [Drift Sign Up page](https://app.drift.com/signup).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
