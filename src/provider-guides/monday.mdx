## Before you get started

To connect Monday with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Monday Account](#create-a-monday-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Monday App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Monday account

You need a **Monday** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a Monday account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Monday signup](https://auth.monday.com/users/sign_up_new) and create a free account using your preferred method.

### Creating a Monday app

Once your Monday account is ready, you need to create a Monday application. Learn more about creating a Monday application [here](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/create-an-app).

## Add Monday app details in Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to add the Monday App.
