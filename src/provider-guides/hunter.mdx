## Before you get started

To use the Hunter connector, you'll need an API key from your Hunter account. Here's how to get it:

1. Log in to your [Hunter account](https://hunter.io/).
2. Go to the [API](https://hunter.io/api-keys) section by clicking on it from the left sidebar.
3. Generate a new API key.


## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Hunter:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key supplied by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.hunter.io`.
