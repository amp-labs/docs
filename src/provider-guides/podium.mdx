## Before You Get Started

To connect Podium with Ampersand, you will need [a Podium Developer Account](https://developer.podium.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to register an app in the Podium developer portal, configure the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Podium Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Podium account:

- Go to the [Podium Developer website](https://developer.podium.com/) and signup for an account.

### Register a Podium App

Follow the steps below to register a Podium app:

1. Log into your [Podium Developer account](https://developer.podium.com/).
2. Click on **Create App**.
3. Enter your app name and click **Create app**.
4. Navigate to the **Oauth** tab in your app. 
5. In the **Redirect URI** section, enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
