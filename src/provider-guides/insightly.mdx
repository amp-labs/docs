#### Custom Objects and Fields
In addition to standard objects, the connector fully supports any custom objects you have created in your Insightly dashboard.
Custom objects are treated as first-class citizens and can be read from and written to like any standard entity.
For each supported object — standard or custom — you can select and request any built-in fields listed in the Insightly API
documentation as well as any custom fields you have defined.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Insightly, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: insightly-integration
    displayName: My Insightly Integration
    provider: insightly
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Insightly:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their username and password.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct header required by Basic Auth. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.insightly.com`.
