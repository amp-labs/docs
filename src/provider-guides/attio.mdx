### Example integration

To define an integration for Attio, create a manifest file that looks like this: https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/attio/amp.yaml

## Before You Get Started

To connect Attio with Ampersand, you will need [an Attio Account](https://app.attio.com/auth/sign-in).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Attio and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create an Attio Account

Here's how you can sign up for an Attio account:

- Go to the [Attio Sign Up page](https://app.attio.com/auth/sign-in).
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating an Attio App

Follow the steps below to create an Attio app and add the Ampersand redirect URL.

1. Log in to your [Attio](https://app.attio.com/auth/sign-in) account.

2. Click **Account Settings** and go to the **Developers** tab.

3. Click **Create a new integration**.

4. In the **Create an integration** pop-up window, enter the **Integration Name**. You can also add a description and app logo.

5. Expand the **Scopes** section and select the scopes applicable for your app.

6. Expand the **OAuth** section. Here, you will find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys for your app. Make a note of these credentials, as you will need them to connect your app to Ampersand.

7. Enable the **OAuth Enabled** switch.

8. In the **Redirect URIs**, add the Ampersand Redirect URI: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Attio:
- Create a manifest file using the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/attio/amp.yaml), see [Define Integrations](/define-integrations/overview) for more info.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
