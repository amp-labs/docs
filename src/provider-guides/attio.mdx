## Before You Get Started

To connect Attio with Ampersand, you will need [an Attio Account](https://app.attio.com/auth/sign-in).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Attio and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

- Go to the [Attio Sign Up page](https://app.attio.com/auth/sign-in).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
