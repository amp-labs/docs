## Before You Get Started

To integrate Atlassian (Jira or Confluence) with Ampersand, you will need [an Atlassian Account](https://id.atlassian.com/signup). 

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Atlassian, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

Note: This guide helps you to connect both **Jira** and **Confluence** in Ampersand. You can use this same guide for both _Jira_ and _Confluence_ and customize the scopes based on your app's specific needs.

### Create an Atlassian Account

Here's how you can sign up for an Atlassian account:

- Go to the [Atlassian Sign Up page](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-software&edition=free&skipBundles=true) and create an account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Adding Scopes in your Atlassian App

You need to define the necessary permissions for your Atlassian app by selecting and adding required scopes, to allow Ampersand to access data effectively. You can limit the access to only the specific scopes needed for your application.

Follow the steps below to add scopes to your Atlassian App:

1. In your [Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/13ac4e18-6cad-4c54-8e38-66697df5d1ef/settings) , select your app. 
2. Go to **Permission**.
3. Select the scopes for your application. Atlassian will authorize access to the selected scopes for your application.
