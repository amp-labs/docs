### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Linear integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/linear/amp.yaml).

## Before you get started

To connect Linear with Ampersand, you need [a Linear Account](https://linear.app/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Linear and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Creating a Linear App

Follow the steps below to create a Linear app.

1. Log in to your [Linear](https://linear.app/login) account.

2. Once logged in, Click the dropdown next to your **workspace name** in the top-left corner, then select **Settings** from the menu.

3. Navigate to **API** menu under **Administration** section.

4. Click **New OAuth Application**.

5. Enter the Application name, Developer name and Developer URL in the respective sections.

6. Enter the Ampersand Callback URLs: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth` in the **Callback URLs** section.

7. [Optional] Enable the **Public** option if you wish to allow this app to be installed by other workspaces.

3. Select **Provider Apps**.  

4. Select Linear from the **Provider** list.

5. Enter the previously obtained Client ID in the **Client ID** field and the Client Secret in the **Client Secret** field.

6. For Scopes you can start with `write` (_which grants the app write access to all objects_) or use more targeted scopes `issues:create` or `comments:create`.
