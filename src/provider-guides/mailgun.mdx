## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.mailgun.net`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Mailgun, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: mailgun-integration
    displayName: My Mailgun Integration
    provider: mailgun
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Mailgun:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their username and password.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct header required by Basic Auth. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.mailgun.net`.

## Credential format for Mailgun

Mailgun uses a non-standard format for Basic Auth, which means that the username and password fields do not correspond to the actual username and password that a customer uses to log in. [Click here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/api-reference/authentication/) for more information about the expected credential format for Mailgun. The UI components will display this link, so that your users can successfully provide their credentials.
