### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of a Snapchat Ads integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/snapchatAds/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

Once your account is created, you'll need to create a Snapchat Ads app and obtain the following credentials:

* Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Snapchat Business Account

If you don't already have a Snapchat Business Account:
* Go to the [Snapchat Business website](https://business.snapchat.com/).
* Click on **Get Started** and follow the prompts to create your account.

### Creating a Snapchat Ads App
