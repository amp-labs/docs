## Before You Get Started

To integrate Keap with Ampersand, you will need a [Keap Developer Account](https://developer.infusionsoft.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Keap and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- App ID
- Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Keap Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Keap account:

- Go to the [Keap Developer Portal](https://developer.infusionsoft.com/).
- Sign up using your preferred method and complete any necessary verification.

### Creating a Keap App

Follow the steps below to create a Keap app and add the Ampersand redirect URL.

1. Log in to your [Keap Developer Portal](https://developer.infusionsoft.com/).
