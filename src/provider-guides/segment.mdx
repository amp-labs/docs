## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.segmentapis.com`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for segment, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: segment-integration
    displayName: My Segment Integration
    provider: segment
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses **API Key authentication**, so you do not need to configure a Provider App before getting started. (Provider Apps are only required for providers using the **OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type**.)

To integrate with Segment:
- Create a manifest file similar to the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component, which will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key provided by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.segmentapis.com`.


## Creating an API key for Segment

1. Log in to the Segment App, and choose the Workspace you want to generate a token for. Each Segment Workspace requires a separate token 
2. Click **Settings** in the left menu to access Workspace Settings. Navigate to the **Access Management** tab, and click **Tokens**. This tab lists any existing tokens created for the Workspace.
3. Click **+Create Token** , and follow the prompts to generate a new token. Be sure to select a Public API token, and not a Config API token. Once generated, store the token somewhere safe, like a password store or other secrets manager
