## Before You Get Started

### Creating an API key for Apollo

[Click here](https://apolloio.github.io/apollo-api-docs/?shell#authentication) for more information about generating an API key for Apollo. The UI components will display this link, so that your users can successfully create API keys.

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Apollo:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/apollo/amp.yaml), see [Define Integrations](/define-integrations/overview) for more info.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
