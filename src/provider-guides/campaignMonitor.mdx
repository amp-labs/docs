## Before You Get Started

To integrate CampaignMonitor with Ampersand, you will need [a CampaignMonitor Account](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to register an OAuth app and obtain the following credentials:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

1. Go to the [CampaignMonitor Sign Up](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/signup/?sv=f_email-signup) page.
2. Fill out the form with your details and create your account.

### Creating a CampaignMonitor OAuth App
