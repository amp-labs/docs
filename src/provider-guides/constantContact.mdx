## Before you get started

To integrate Constant Contact with Ampersand, you must have a Constant Contact Developer account and obtain the necessary credentials.

Once your account is set up, you'll need to create an app in Constant Contact to get the following credentials:

- **Client Secret**

You will use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.
