## Before You Get Started

Before creating a **Salesloft** app, you need to sign up for a _Salesloft Developer License_. This license grants you the access and permissions needed to set up your development environment and manage your Salesloft applications.

To get started, simply contact the Salesloft team at [partners@salesloft.com](mailto:partners@salesloft.com.) and get your Developer License.

After your account is set up, you will need to create a Salesloft app and acquire the following credentials from your Salesloft app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Creating a Salesloft App

Once your Salesloft account is ready, you need to create a Salesloft application. 

1. Log in to your **Salesloft** account.

2. Navigate to **Salesloft OAuth Applications**. You can do this by selecting the OAuth Applications section from your Salesloft developer dashboard.

3. If this is your first app, click **Create your first app**. Click **Create New** under OAuth applications if you have already created an app before.

4. Enter the following details for the new app:
   - **Name**: The name of your product
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
   - **Application Type**: select "Yes, this will be a public application"

5. Once the app is created, note down the **Application ID** and **Secret**. You will need these to connect your app with Ampersand.

## Add Salesloft App Details in Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to add the Salesloft App.

3. Select **Provider apps**.

4. Select _Salesloft_ from the **Provider** list.

5. Enter the previously obtained _Application ID_ in the **Client ID** field, the _Secret_ in the **Client Secret** field, and the requested scopes in the **Permissions** field.
