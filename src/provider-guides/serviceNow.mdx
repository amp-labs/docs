## What's Supported

### Supported Actions
This connector supports:
* **Proxy Actions**, using the base URL `https://{{.workspace}}.service-now.com`.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate ServiceNow with Ampersand, you will need [a ServiceNow Instance](https://www.servicenow.com/).

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

* Go to the [ServiceNow Developer Portal](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/home).
* Sign up for a Personal Developer Instance (PDI).
