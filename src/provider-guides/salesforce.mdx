### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of a Salesforce integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/salesforce/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Salesforce with Ampersand, you need to Create a Salesforce Account and obtain the following credentials from a Salesforce Connected App:

- Consumer Key
- Consumer Secret

### Create a Salesforce Account

You need a Salesforce account to create integrations using Ampersand. If you do not have a Salesforce account, here's how you can sign up for a free Developer Account:

- Go to the [Salesforce Developer site](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) and sign up for a free developer account.
- Fill in the required details and click on **Sign Me Up**.
- Verify your email and complete the registration process.

### Create a Salesforce Connected App

To create Salesforce integrations with Ampersand, you'll need to first create a Connected App in Salesforce. Follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your Salesforce account.

2. Navigate to the gear icon in the top right corner and select **Setup**.

   <br />

5. Enter  **Connected App Name**, **API Name**, and **Contact Email**.

6. Select the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox to configure the OAuth settings:

   1. Enter the **Callback URL**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
   2. Select the applicable OAuth Scopes from the list and click **Add**. You must always include the following scopes:
   - Perform requests at any time (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)
   - Manage user data via APIs (`api`)

   > ✅ For more details on which OAuth scopes to include, refer to the [OAuth Tokens and Scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm&language=en_US&type=5) guide.

   3. Uncheck the **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) Extension for Supported Authorization Flows** checkbox.

7. Click **Save**.

### Obtain Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

Now that you have created a Connected App in Salesforce, you can obtain your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. These credentials will be used in the next step, where you will [connect your application to Ampersand](https://docs.withampersand.com/docs/salesforce-guide#connecting--salesforce-to-ampersand) .

In the **Platform Tools >> Apps >> App Manager** section, find your newly created connected App and follow the steps below to obtain Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. 

1. Click the dropdown arrow next to your app and select **View**.
2. Click **Manage Consumer Details**.
3. Complete the verification and you will be able to access the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**. 

Copy these keys and use them in the next step to connect Salesforce to Ampersand.

## Provide Salesforce Connected App info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create a Salesforce integration.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Salesforce:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/salesforce/amp.yaml), see [Define Integrations](/define-integrations/overview) for more info.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
