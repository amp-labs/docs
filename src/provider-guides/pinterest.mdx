### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Pinterest integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/pinterest/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Pinterest with Ampersand, you will need a [Pinterest Developer Account](https://developers.pinterest.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Pinterest, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- App ID
- App Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Pinterest Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Pinterest account:

- Go to the [Pinterest Sign Up page](https://www.pinterest.com/join/) and create a business account.
- Verify your account's email address. 
- [Sign In](https://developers.pinterest.com/) to the newly created account and go to **My apps**.
- Click through to accept Pinterest Developer Terms of Service.

### Creating a Pinterest App

Follow the steps below to create a Pinterest app:

1. Log in to your [Pinterest Developer Console](https://developers.pinterest.com/).
2. Click **My Apps**.
3. Click **Connect App**.
4. Enter the app details and click **Submit**.

2. Go to **My apps** and select **Manage** for the app you want to configure.
