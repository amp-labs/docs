## Before You Get Started

To integrate Pinterest with Ampersand, you will need a [Pinterest Developer Account](https://developers.pinterest.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Pinterest, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- App ID
- App Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

- Go to the [Pinterest Sign Up page](https://www.pinterest.com/join/) and create a business account.
