### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a Sage Intacct integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/sageintacct/amp.yaml).

## Before you get started

To integrate Sage Intacct with Ampersand, you will need access to a [Sage Developer Account](https://developer.sage.com/intacct/).

Once you have access, you'll need to create an app in Sage Intacct, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your Sage Intacct instance:

- Client ID
- Secret Key 
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Sage Intacct app

- Log in to your [Sage Developer Account](https://developer.sage.com/intacct/).
- From the navigation menu, select **Applications** > **New Application**.
- Select **Sage Intacct** and select **Continue**.
- Enter the app details and click **Continue**.
- In the **Redirect URIs** section and enter the Ampersand **Callback URI**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
- Add your Intacct Web Services License Password
- From the Client Scope dropdown list, choose the environment type that the application will be used with.
- Click **Create Application**.
- After creating the application, you will see the **Client ID** and **Secret Key**. Make sure to copy these values as you will need them later.


## Add Your Sage Intacct app info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create a Sage Intacct integration.
