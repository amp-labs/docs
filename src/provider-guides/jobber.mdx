## What's Supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.getjobber.com/api/graphql`.

## Before you get started

To connect Jobber with Ampersand, you will need a [Jobber Account](https://www.getjobber.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to [Create a Jobber Developer Account](https://developer.getjobber.com) and obtain the following credentials from your Jobber App:
- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

<Note>
  Jobber uses GraphQL for all API operations. When making proxy calls, you must include the `X-JOBBER-GRAPHQL-VERSION` header with the API version (e.g., `2025-01-20`) in all requests, as this is mandatory for Jobber's GraphQL API. You can find the latest API version information in the [Jobber API Changelog](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/changelog/).
