### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Jobber integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/jobber/amp.yaml).

## Before you get started

To connect Jobber with Ampersand, you will need a [Jobber Account](https://www.getjobber.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to [Create a Jobber Developer Account](https://developer.getjobber.com) and obtain the following credentials from your Jobber App:
- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

<Note>
  Jobber uses GraphQL for all API operations. When making proxy calls, you must include the `X-JOBBER-GRAPHQL-VERSION` header with the API version (e.g., `2025-01-20`) in all requests, as this is mandatory for Jobber's GraphQL API. You can find the latest API version information in the [Jobber API Changelog](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/changelog/).
</Note>

### Create a Jobber developer account

Here's how you can sign up for a Jobber account:

- Go to the [Jobber Developer Center](https://developer.getjobber.com/signup/) and create a developer account.
- Complete the registration process and verify your email.

## Creating a Jobber app

Once your Jobber Developer account is ready, you need to create a Jobber application:

1. Log in to your [Jobber Developer Center](https://developer.getjobber.com/).
2. Navigate to the [Apps page](https://developer.getjobber.com/apps).
3. Click **NEW** to create your first app.
4. Fill in the required information:
   - **App name** (required)
   - **Developer name** (required) 
   - **OAuth Callback URL**: Use `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
   - **App description** (required)
   - **Scopes** (required) - Select the data access permissions your app needs

5. Click **Save** to create your app.

Upon creation, the app will display the necessary credentials: **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Note these down, as you will need it to connect your app to Ampersand.
