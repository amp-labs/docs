## Before You Get Started

To integrate **Aircall** with **Ampersand**, you must register an **Aircall OAuth2** application. To do this, contact `marketplace@aircall.io` and provide the following details:

- **Name** and **Purpose** of your application.
- **Redirect URI** for an HTTPS endpoint that will handle the secure callback. Use the following callback URL for Ampersand integration: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
- **Install URI**: A valid installation URI for your application.

Once you have registered your application, you will receive two credentials: **client_id** and **client_secret**. These are required to connect Aircall with Ampersand.

## Add Your Aircall App Info to Ampersand

Once you have your Aircall app set up and registered, you can proceed to connect it with Ampersand by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create an _Aircall_ integration.
