## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

The Outreach connector supports:
- [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), including full historic backfill and incremental read.
- [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.outreach.io`.

### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of a Outreach integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/outreach/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

Before creating a **Outreach** app, you must complete the Outreach partnership process to obtain a sandbox instance. Please ensure that you add `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth` as a callback URL for the Outreach app.

After your account is set up, you will need to acquire the following credentials from your Outreach app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand. 

## Add Outreach App Details in Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to add the Outreach App.

3. Select **Provider apps**.

4. Select Outreach from the **Provider** list.

5. Enter the Outreach Application ID in the **Client ID** field, the Outreach Application Secret in the **Client Secret** field, and the requested scopes in the **Permissions** field.

6. Enter the scopes defined for the _Outreach_ application.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Outreach:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/outreach/amp.yaml), see [Define Integrations](/define-integrations/overview) for more info.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.

## Publish your Outreach app

When you are ready to publish your Outreach app to the Outreach Marketplace, follow the instructions on the [Outreach documentation](https://developers.outreach.io/guides/managing-apps/#publishing-apps).

## Limitations of development credentials

Please note that until you publish your app, there are limitations on the credentials you obtain via your Ampersand integration. While an unpublished app can be used to connect to other Outreach workspaces, such as those of your customers, Outreach will expire those credentials weekly. This means that your customers will need to re-install their integrations weekly. Refer to the [Outreach documentation](https://developers.outreach.io/api/oauth/#limitations-of-development-credentials) for more details.

Even after you publish your Outreach app, be sure to select the "Production" tab and use the Application ID and Secret from that tab for your Ampersand Provider App.
