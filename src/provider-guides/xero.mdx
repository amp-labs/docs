### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Xero integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/xero/amp.yaml).

## Before you get started

To integrate Xero with Ampersand, you will need a Xero developer account and a registered Xero app. See the Xero developer site for details: https://developer.xero.com/.

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Xero, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Xero account

Here's how to get started with Xero:

- Go to the [Xero homepage](https://www.xero.com/) and sign up for a free trial or an account.
- Verify your email address and complete your organisation setup.
- Sign in to [Xero](https://login.xero.com/) and then visit the [Xero developer portal](https://developer.xero.com/).

### Creating a Xero app

Follow the steps below to create a Xero app in the Xero developer console:

1. Sign in to the [Xero developer portal](https://developer.xero.com/).
2. Open the "My apps" page.
3. Click **New app** (or **Create app**).
4. Enter your app name, company/website, and set the Redirect URI to the Ampersand callback URI: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
6. Save the app and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** shown on the app details page.

6. Enter the [scopes](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/scopes) set for your application.

7. Click **Save changes**.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Xero:
- Create a manifest file using the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/xero/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for OAuth authorization.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
