## Before you get started

To use the Salesfinity connector, you'll need an API key from your Salesfinity account. Here's how to get it:

1. Log in to your Salesfinity account.
2. Go to **Settings** and head over to **Connections & API**.
3. Generate a new API key.

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Salesfinity:

- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start using the connector!
  - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
  - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
  - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
