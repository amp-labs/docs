#### Custom Fields
In addition to standard fields, the connector supports any **custom fields** created through the Copper API.
They behave the same way as built-in fields and can be queried alongside them.

Copper does not provide a dedicated "field name" for custom fields.
To represent them, the connector uses the **display name** rather than the numeric ID, and exposes it with the prefix `custom_field_`.
* **Prefix**: Names always start with `custom_field_`.
* **Display name**: Human-readable display names are used instead of IDs, with spaces replaced by underscores.
> Example: A custom field with display name `Contract Start Date` in Copper is exposed as `custom_field_contract_start_date`.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Copper CRM with Ampersand, you must register _Copper CRM Oauth2_ application. To register the application, you must contact `partners@copper.com` and provide the following details:

- **Name** and **Purpose** of your application.
- **URL** for an HTTPS endpoint that will handle the secure callback. If you want to connect via Ampersand, use the following callback URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.

After registering your application, you'll receive two credentials: **client_id** and **client_secret**. These are required to connect with Ampersand.

## Add Your Copper CRM App Info to Ampersand

Once you have your Copper app set up and registered, you can proceed to connect it with Ampersand by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create a Copper CRM integration.
