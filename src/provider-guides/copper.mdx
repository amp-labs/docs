## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.copper.com/developer_api`.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Copper CRM with Ampersand, you must register _Copper CRM Oauth2_ application. To register the application, you must contact `partners@copper.com` and provide the following details:

- **Name** and **Purpose** of your application.
- **URL** for an HTTPS endpoint that will handle the secure callback. If you want to connect via Ampersand, use the following callback URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.

After registering your application, you'll receive two credentials: **client_id** and **client_secret**. These are required to connect with Ampersand.

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).
