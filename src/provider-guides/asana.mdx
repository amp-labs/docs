To integrate Asana with Ampersand, you will need [an Asana Account](https://asana.com/create-account).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Asana, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create an Asana Account

Here's how you can sign up for an Asana account:

- Go to the [Asana Sign Up page](https://asana.com/create-account).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
