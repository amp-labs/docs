## Before You Get Started

To integrate Aha! with Ampersand, you need to [Create an Aha! Account](#create-an-aha-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Aha! App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create an Aha! Account

You need an **Aha!** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have an Aha! account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Aha! site](https://www.aha.io/) and sign up for a free account.
- Sign up using your preferred account.
- Verify your email and complete the registration process.

### Creating an Aha! App

Once your Aha! account is ready, you need to create an Aha! application. Learn more about creating an Aha! application [here](https://www.aha.io/support/api/authentication).

1. Log in to Your [Aha! Account](https://www.aha.io/).

2. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner and then click **Personal**.

3. On the _Personal_ settings page, click **Developer**.

   

4. Click the **OAuth applications** tab.

The OAuth applications tab shows **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys.
