The Google connector supports Google products which have APIs with the root URL `googleapis.com`, these include:

- Google Drive
- Calendar

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Google with Ampersand, you will need a [Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create a Google app, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Google Cloud Account

You can sign up for a [free Google Cloud account here](https://cloud.google.com/free).

### Enable the appropriate APIs

Go to the [API Library page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) of Google Cloud Console and search for the APIs your integration will need. For example, if you are building a Google Drive integration, type "Google Drive", select the right API and click the "Enable" button.

Repeat this process for all the APIs your integration will need.

### Creating a Google App

Follow the steps below to create a Google App:

1. Go to the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) page, pick "External" as the User Type.

<br />

2. Enter the information required on the next page, click "Save and Continue".

**Important information about App Logo**: when you are creating a Google app for development purposes, do not upload a logo. Uploading a logo will trigger an app verification process. When you are ready to submit your app for review by Google, then you can come back to this page and upload a logo.

3. On the Scopes page, click "Add or Remove Scopes", and then select the scopes that your integration will need. For example, if you are integrating with Google Drive, type "Google Drive" into the search box and select the scopes you will need. If the scopes you require are not popping up, ensure that you've enabled the appropriate APIs (previous step), and then refresh the page.
