## What's Supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.whereby.dev`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Whereby, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
  - name: whereBy-integration
    displayName: Whereby
    provider: whereby
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses **API Key authentication**, so you do not need to configure a Provider App before getting started. (Provider Apps are only required for providers using the **OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type**.)

To integrate with Whereby:
- Create a manifest file similar to the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component, which will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key provided by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.whereby.dev`.
