  - name: heyreach-integration
    displayName: My HeyReach Integration

    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with HeyReach:

- Create a manifest file using the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/heyreach/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
