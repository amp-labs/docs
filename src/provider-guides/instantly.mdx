### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Instantly integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/instantly/amp.yaml).


## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Instantly:

- Create a manifest file using the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/instantly/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.

## Creating an API key for Instantly:

1. Log in to your [Instantly Account](https://app.instantly.ai/auth/login).

2. Navigate to **settings**.

3. Click **Integraions** and navigate to **APIKeys**.

4. Click **Create API Key**.
