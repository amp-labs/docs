## Before you get started

To connect Klaviyo with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Klaviyo Account](#create-a-klaviyo-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Klaviyo App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Klaviyo account

You need a **Klaviyo** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a Klaviyo account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Klaviyo site](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and sign up for a free account using your preferred method.

### Creating a Klaviyo app

Once your Klaviyo account is ready, you need to create a Klaviyo application. Learn more about creating a Klaviyo application [here](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/create_a_public_oauth_app).

1. Log in to the [Klaviyo dashboard](https://www.klaviyo.com/login).
