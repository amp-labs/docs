### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of a Klaviyo integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/klaviyo/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To connect Webflow with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Webflow Account](#create-a-webflow-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Webflow App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Klaviyo Account

You need a **Klaviyo** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a Klaviyo account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Klaviyo site](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and sign up for a free account using your preferred method.

### Creating a Klaviyo App

Once your Klaviyo account is ready, you need to create a Klaviyo application. Learn more about creating a Klaviyo application [here](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/create_a_public_oauth_app).

1. Log in to the [Klaviyo dashboard](https://www.klaviyo.com/login).

2. Then visit [Manage Apps](https://www.klaviyo.com/manage-apps) to create a new app.
Otherwise, this can be found by clicking on avatar, go to **Integrations**, click on **Developers** dropdown and then select **Manage apps**.

3. On the Create a New App form, enter your application name. [Create App Form](/images/provider-guides/klaviyo-app-form.png)
You can find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys on the app details page. Note these keys, as they are essential for connecting your app to Ampersand.

4. Click **Create**. [Application Info](/images/provider-guides/klaviyo-app-info.png)
