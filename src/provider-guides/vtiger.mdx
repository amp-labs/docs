## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions).
   - If your instance name is **your_instance.odx**, the base URL for API requests will be: https://your_instance.odx/restapi.

### Example integration

To define an integration for vtiger, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: vtiger-integration
    displayName: Vtiger
    provider: vtiger
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with vtiger:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their username and password.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct header required by Basic Auth. Please note that if your instance name is **your_instance.odx**, then connector's base URL will be: https://your_instance.odx/restapi.
