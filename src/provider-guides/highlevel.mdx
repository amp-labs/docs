### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an HighLevel integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/highlevel/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To connect HighLevel with Ampersand, you need [a HighLevel Account](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in HighLevel and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a HighLevel Account

Here's how you can sign up for a HighLevel account:

- Go to the [HighLevel Sign Up page](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/signup).
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating an HighLevel App

1. Log in to your [HighLevel](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/login) account.

2. Navigate to **App Dashboard** and Click **Create App** then **Create an app** modal will open.

3. In the modal, enter the **App Name**. 

4. Select **App Type**: Public, select **Distribution Type** and select the **Listing Type**.
