## Before you get started

To integrate Webex with Ampersand, you will need [a Cisco Webex Account](https://www.webex.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an integration in Webex and obtain the following credentials from your integration:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Creating a Webex Integration

<Note>
  The Admin API is a superset of user-level APIs. Some objects (such as events,
  organizations, and reports) require organization-level admin scopes, while
  others (such as meetings) can be accessed with user-level scopes. Refer to the
  [Webex API documentation](https://developer.webex.com) to determine which
  account type and scopes are required for your use case.
</Note>

Follow the steps below to create a Cisco Webex integration and add the Ampersand redirect URL to the integration:

1. Log in to your [Webex Developer Portal](https://developer.webex.com/) account.

2. Click **My Apps** in the top navigation.

3. Click **Create a New App**.

4. Select **Integration** as the app type.

5. Enter your **App Name**.

6. Enter a **Description** for your integration.

7. Enter Ampersand's **Redirect URI**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.

8. Under **Scopes**, select the necessary [Scopes](https://developer.webex.com/create/docs/integrations#scopes) for your integration.

9. Click **Add Integration**.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Webex:

- Create a manifest file.

- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).

- If you're using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).

- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. This UI component will prompt the customer for OAuth authorization.

- Start using the connector!

  - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
  - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
  - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
