### Example integration

To define an integration for Granola, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```yaml
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: granolaIntegration
    displayName: Granola Integration
    provider: granola
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Before you get started

To use the Granola connector, you’ll need an API key from your Granola account. Here’s how to get it:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Workspaces**.
2. Select the **API** tab.
3. Click **Generate API Key**.

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To integrate with Granola:

- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start using the connector!
  - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
  - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
