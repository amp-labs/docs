## What's supported

### Supported actions

RingOver provides two separate APIs for US and EU regions. Each region requires its own API key and has a different base URL. We provide two connectors to support this:

1. RingOver US connector:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://public-api-us.ringover.com`

2. RingOver EU connector:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://public-api.ringover.com`

> **Important:** API keys generated for the US region will not work with the EU base URL and vice versa. Make sure to use the appropriate connector and API key for your region.

### Example integrations

#### For US Region:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: ringover-us-integration
    displayName: My RingOver US Integration
    provider: ringOverUS
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

#### For EU Region:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: ringover-eu-integration
    displayName: My RingOver EU Integration
    provider: ringOverEU
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

Both connectors use API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with RingOver:
- Determine which region (US or EU) your RingOver account belongs to
- Create a manifest file using the appropriate example above
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview)
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key supplied by the customer
