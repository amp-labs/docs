## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Read Actions](/read-actions), including full historic backfill. Please note that incremental read is supported only for `calls`, currently. For all other objects, a full read of the Clari Copilot instance will be done per scheduled read.
- [Write Actions](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://rest-api.copilot.clari.com`.

> **Important Note on Incremental Reads for Calls**: The incremental read functionality for `calls` is based on the `last_modified_time` field. However, this timestamp only updates when the call's status changes, not when other fields (like name, email, etc.) are modified. This means that incremental reads may miss updates to non-status fields that occur between scheduled reads.


### Supported Objects

- [accounts](https://api-doc.copilot.clari.com/#tag/account/paths/~1create-account/post) (write)

### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a Clari Copilot integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/clariCopilot/amp.yaml).


## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth along with an API Secret, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Clari Copilot:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their API Key and API Secret.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach both required authentication headers supplied by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://rest-api.copilot.clari.com`.


### Creating API credentials

1. Log in to your Clari Copilot account.
2. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** > **Integrations** > **Clari Copilot API**.

3. You'll find both your API Key and API Secret in this section.
