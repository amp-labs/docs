### Example integration

To define an integration for Clari Copilot, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: clari-copilot-integration
    displayName: My Clari Copilot Integration
    provider: clariCopilot
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth along with an API Secret, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Clari Copilot:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their API Key and API Secret.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach both required authentication headers supplied by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://rest-api.copilot.clari.com`.


### Creating API credentials

1. Log in to your Clari Copilot account.
2. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** > **Integrations** > **Clari Copilot API**.
