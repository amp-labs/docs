## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.workspace}}`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Coupa, create a manifest file that looks like this:


```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: coupa-integration
    displayName: My Coupa Integration
    provider: coupa
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Before you get started

To connect _Coupa_ with _Ampersand_, you will need a [Coupa account](https://www.coupa.com).

Once your account is ready, you'll need to create a Coupa OAuth2 app and obtain the following credentials:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will also need your **Coupa instance domain** (the `workspace` value), which is your Coupa instance URL (e.g., `mycompany.coupahost.com`).

### Creating a Coupa app

1. Log in to your Coupa instance as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Setup** → **Oauth2 / OpenID Connect Clients**.
3. Click **Create** to register a new OAuth2 client.
4. Fill in the application name and description.
5. Under **Redirect URI**, add the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
6. Select the scopes your integration requires.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

For more details, refer to the [Coupa API get started guide](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api/get-started-with-the-api).

### Add your Coupa app info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).
2. Select the project where you want to create a Coupa integration.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Coupa:
- Create a manifest file like the [example above](#example-integration).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for OAuth authorization and their Coupa instance domain.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.

Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://{{.workspace}}`, where `workspace` is your Coupa instance domain (e.g., `mycompany.coupahost.com`).
