## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

This connector supports:
- [Read Actions](/read-actions), including full historic backfill and incremental read.
- [Write Actions](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{account_id}.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com`, where `{account_id}` is your NetSuite account ID.

### Supported Modules

The NetSuite connector supports the following modules:
- SuiteQL (`suiteql`) - this is a read-only module that allows you to read data from NetSuite using SuiteQL.
- REST API (`restapi`) - this module allows you to read and write data to NetSuite using the REST API.

By default, the connector will use the `restapi` module. To deploy the connector with the `suiteql` module, you will need to specify the `module` field in the YAML manifest file.

```yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: netsuite-suiteql-integration
    provider: netsuite
    module: suiteql
    ...
```

For an example manifest file of a NetSuite integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/netsuite/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate NetSuite with Ampersand, you will need [a NetSuite Account](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an OAuth 2.0 application in NetSuite, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the application, and obtain the following credentials from your application:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a NetSuite Account

Here's how you can sign up for a NetSuite account:

- Go to the [NetSuite website](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml).
- Sign up using your preferred method or contact NetSuite sales for enterprise accounts.

### Creating a NetSuite Integration

Follow the steps below to create a NetSuite integration and add the Ampersand redirect URL.

1. Log in to your NetSuite account as an Administrator.
2. Navigate to **Setup** > **Integration** > **Manage Integrations**.
3. Click the **New** button to create a new integration.
4. Enter the following integration details:
   1. **Name**: The name of your integration.
   2. **Description**: A description of your integration.
   3. **Callback URL**: Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
5. Under the **Authentication** tab:
   1. Check **Authorization Code Grant**.
   2. Check **REST Web Services** to allow REST API access.
   3. Uncheck any other authentication methods (TBA, etc.)
   4. Check **Public Client** to allow OAuth 2.0 public clients.
6. Click **Save**.

After saving, NetSuite will generate:
- **Consumer Key** (this is your OAuth Client ID)
- **Consumer Secret** (this is your OAuth Client Secret)

Make note of these credentials as they are necessary for connecting your app to Ampersand.

## Add Your NetSuite Integration Info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create a NetSuite integration.

3. Select **Provider Apps**.

4. Select _NetSuite_ from the **Provider** list.

5. Enter the previously obtained _Consumer Key_ in the **Client ID** field and _Consumer Secret_ in the **Client Secret** field.\

6. Enter the `rest_webservices` scope in the **Scopes** field.

7. Click **Save Changes**.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with NetSuite:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/netsuite/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
