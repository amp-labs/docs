## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{account_id}.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com`, where `{account_id}` is your NetSuite account ID.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate NetSuite with Ampersand, you will need [a NetSuite Account](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an OAuth 2.0 application in NetSuite, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the application, and obtain the following credentials from your application:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a NetSuite Account

Here's how you can sign up for a NetSuite account:

- Go to the [NetSuite website](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml).
- Sign up using your preferred method or contact NetSuite sales for enterprise accounts.

### Creating a NetSuite Integration

Follow the steps below to create a NetSuite integration and add the Ampersand redirect URL.

1. Log in to your NetSuite account as an Administrator.
2. Navigate to **Setup** > **Integration** > **Manage Integrations**.
3. Click the **New** button to create a new integration.
4. Enter the following integration details:
   1. **Name**: The name of your integration.
   2. **Description**: A description of your integration.
   3. **Callback URL**: Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
5. Under the **Authentication** tab:
   1. Check **Authorization Code Grant**.
   2. Check **RESTlets** if you plan to use custom RESTlets.
   3. Check **REST Web Services** for REST API access.
   4. Uncheck any other authentication methods (TBA, etc.)
   5. Check **Public Client** if you plan to allow OAuth 2.0 public clients with this integration.
6. Click **Save**.

After saving, NetSuite will generate:
- **Consumer Key** (this is your OAuth Client ID)
- **Consumer Secret** (this is your OAuth Client Secret)

Make note of these credentials as they are necessary for connecting your app to Ampersand.
