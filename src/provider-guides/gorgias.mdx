### Example integration

To define an integration for Gorgias, create a manifest file that looks like this: https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/gorgias/amp.yaml

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Gorgias with Ampersand, you will need [a Gorgias Account](https://www.gorgias.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to register an OAuth app and obtain the following credentials:
* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

Here's how you can sign up for a Gorgias account:

* Go to the [Gorgias Developer Sign Up](https://partners.gorgias.com/login) page.
* Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating a Gorgias OAuth App
