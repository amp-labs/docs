## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:

- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.devrev.ai`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for DevRev, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: devrevIntegration
    displayName: Devrev Integration
    provider: devrev
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Before you get started

To use the DevRev connector, you'll need a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your DevRev account. Here's how to get it:

1. In the DevRev app, go to the relevant dev org.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Personal Access Token**.
3. Click **New token** and follow the workflow to create your PAT.

For more details, see the [DevRev Authentication documentation](https://developer.devrev.ai/about/authentication).

## Using the connector

This connector uses Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To integrate with DevRev:

- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their PAT.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the PAT supplied by the customer.
