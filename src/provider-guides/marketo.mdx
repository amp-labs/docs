## Using the connector

This connector uses OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)


To start integrating with Marketo:
- Create a manifest file.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
