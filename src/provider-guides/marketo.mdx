## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions), including full historic backfill. Please note that incremental read is only supported for Leads and Lead Changes. For other objects, a full read of the Marketo instance will be done each time.
- [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.workspace}}.mktorest.com`.

## Using the connector

This connector uses OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Marketo:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for the correct credentials.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct tokens, and manage their refreshes. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://{{.workspace}}.mktorest.com`.
