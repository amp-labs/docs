## Before You Get Started

To integrate Zendesk with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Zendesk Account](#create-a-zendesk-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Zendesk App:

- Client ID/Unique identifier
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

- Sign up using your preferred account.

### Creating a Zendesk App

   2. **Description**: Description for the OAuth client.
   3. **Redirect URI**: Enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
