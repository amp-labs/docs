## Before You Get Started

To integrate Jira with Ampersand, you will need [a Jira Account](https://id.atlassian.com/signup). 

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Jira, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Jira Account

Here's how you can sign up for a JIRA account:

- Go to the [Jira Sign Up page](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-software&edition=free&skipBundles=true) and create an account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating a Jira App

Follow the steps below to create a _Jira_ app:

1. Log in to your [Atlassian Developer Console](https://id.atlassian.com/login/select-account?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.atlassian.com%2F).

### Adding Scopes in your Jira App

You need to define the necessary permissions for your Jira app by selecting and adding required scopes, to allow Ampersand to access data effectively.

Follow the steps below to add scopes to your Jira App:

1. In your [Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/13ac4e18-6cad-4c54-8e38-66697df5d1ef/settings), select your app. 
2. Go to **Permission**.
3. Select the scopes for your application. Jira will authorize access to the selected scopes for your application.
