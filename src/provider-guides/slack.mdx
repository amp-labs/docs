## Before You Get Started

To connect Slack with Ampersand, you will need [a Slack Developer Account](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/join).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Slack, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Slack Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Slack account:

- Go to the [Slack Sign Up page](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/join).
- Sign up using your preferred method and verify your email.

### Creating a Slack App

Follow the steps below to create a Slack app and add the Ampersand redirect URL.

1. Log in to your [Slack Developer](https://slack.com/signin) account.
