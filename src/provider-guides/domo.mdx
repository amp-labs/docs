## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.domo.com`.

## Before you get started

To connect Domo with Ampersand, you will need a [Domo account](https://www.domo.com/).

### Example integration

To define an integration for Domo, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
#amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
  - name: domoIntegration
    displayName: Domo
    provider: domo
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Creating a Domo client application

Follow these steps to create a client application in Domo:

1. Log in to your [Domo Developer Portal](https://developer.domo.com/).
2. Navigate to **My Account**
3. Click **New Client**.
4. Enter a name for your application and select the appropriate scopes based on your integration needs.
5. Click **Create**.

## Using the connector
This connector uses OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Domo:
- Create a manifest file using the [example](#example-integration) above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically handle the authentication with Domo.
