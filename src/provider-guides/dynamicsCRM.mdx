### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of an Dynamics CRM integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/dynamicsCRM/%20amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To connect **Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM** with **Ampersand**, you will need an active [Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM Account](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/crm/).

Once your account is set up, you'll need to register an application in the **Microsoft Entra** developer portal. After registering your app, you will need to configure it and obtain the following credentials:

- **Application (client) ID**
- **Client Secret**

You will then use these credentials to connect Dynamics 365 CRM to Ampersand.

- Go to the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/free-trial) and sign up for a new account or start a free trial.
- If you don't have a **Microsoft Entra** (formerly Azure Active Directory) tenant, follow the instructions in [Set up Microsoft Entra ID access for your Developer Site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant) to associate your Microsoft 365 subscription with an Azure subscription.
