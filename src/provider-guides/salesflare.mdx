## Before You Get Started

To use the Salesflare connector, you'll need an API key from your Salesflare account. Here's how to get it:

1. Log in to your [Salesflare account](https://app.salesflare.com/).
2. Go to Settings > API Keys.
3. Generate a new API key.

For more information about authentication, see the [Salesflare API documentation](https://api.salesflare.com/docs#section/Introduction/Authentication).

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Salesflare:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key supplied by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.salesflare.com`.
