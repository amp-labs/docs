## Before You Get Started

To integrate GitHub with Ampersand, you will need [a GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create a GitHub OAuth app and obtain the following credentials:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Creating a GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "OAuth Apps" in the sidebar
3. Click "New OAuth App"
4. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application name**: Your application name
   - **Homepage URL**: Your application's homepage URL
   - **Application description**: (Optional) Description of your application
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
5. Click "Register application"
6. On the next screen, click "Generate a new client secret"
7. Save your Client ID and Client Secret - you'll need these for the next step

## Add Your GitHub App Info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Provider apps"
4. Select "GitHub" from the provider list
5. Enter your OAuth app credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
6. Click "Save changes"

## Making API Calls

When making API calls, be aware that:
- The base URL for all API calls is `https://api.github.com`
- Rate limits apply based on authentication method
- Some endpoints require specific scopes to be authorized
- For incremental sync, use ISO 8601 timestamps with the `since` parameter (e.g., `2024-03-15T14:30:45Z`)

For more details about available endpoints and their requirements, refer to the [GitHub REST API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
