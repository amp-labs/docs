## Before you get started

To integrate GitHub with Ampersand, you will need a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create a GitHub OAuth app and obtain the following credentials:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Creating a GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "OAuth Apps" in the sidebar
3. Click "New OAuth App"
4. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application name**: Your application name
   - **Homepage URL**: Your application's homepage URL
   - **Application description**: (Optional) Description of your application
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
5. Click "Register application"
6. On the next screen, click "Generate a new client secret"
7. Save your Client ID and Client Secret - you'll need these for the next step

## Add your GitHub App info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com)
2. Select your project

3. Go to **Provider apps**
4. Select __GitHub__ from the **Provider list**
5. Enter your OAuth app credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret

6. Click **Save changes**


## Using the connector

To start integrating with Intercom:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/github/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
