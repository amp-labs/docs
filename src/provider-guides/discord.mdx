## Before You Get Started

To connect Discord with Ampersand, you will need [a Discord Account](#create-a-discord-account).

Once your account is created, you'll need to configure an app in Discord and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Discord Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Discord Developer account:

- Go to the [Discord Sign Up page](https://discord.com/register) and create an account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.
