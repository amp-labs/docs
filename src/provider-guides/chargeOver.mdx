## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.domain}}.chargeover.com`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for ChargeOver, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: chargeOver-integration
    displayName: My ChargeOver Integration
    provider: chargeOver
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with ChargeOver:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their domain, username and password.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct header required by Basic Auth. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://{{.domain}}.chargeover.com`.

## Creating Basic Auth credentials

To begin using the API in your ChargeOver account, you need to enable REST API support:

- Navigate to Settings.
- Click on Developers > More Dev Tools.
- Click the Get Started button under REST API.
- Enable the REST API. Once enabled, your username and password for Basic Authentication will be displayed.
