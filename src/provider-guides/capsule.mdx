## Before You Get Started

To integrate Capsule CRM with Ampersand, you will need [a Capsule CRM Developer Account](https://developer.capsulecrm.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Capsule CRM, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will then use these credentials and scopes to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Capsule CRM Account

- Go to the [Capsule CRM Developer portal](https://developer.capsulecrm.com/) and sign up using your _Github_ account.
