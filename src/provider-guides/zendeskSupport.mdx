## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.workspace}}.zendesk.com/api`.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Zendesk with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Zendesk Account](#create-a-zendesk-account) and obtain the following credentials from your Zendesk App:

- Client ID/Unique identifier
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Zendesk Account

You need a **Zendesk** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a Zendesk account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Zendesk site](https://www.zendesk.com/) and sign up for a free account.
- Sign up using your preferred account.

### Creating a Zendesk App

1. Log in to Your [Zendesk Account](https://www.zendesk.com/login/).

2. Go to **Admin Center**.

3. On the _Admin Center_ page, click **Apps and integrations**.

4. Click the **API** tab.

5. Click **OAuth Clients**.

6. On the _OAuth Clients_ page, click **Add OAuth client**.

7. On the _Add OAuth client_ form, enter the following details:
   1. **Client Name**: The name of the OAuth client.
   2. **Description**: Description for the OAuth client.
   3. **Redirect URI**: Enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`

8. Click **Save**.

You can find the **Unique Identifier** and **Client Secret** keys in the OAuth tab. Note these keys, as they are essential for connecting your app to Ampersand.
