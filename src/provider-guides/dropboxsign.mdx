### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a Dropbox Sign integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/dropbox-sign/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Dropbox Sign with Ampersand, you will need a [Dropbox Sign Account](https://sign.dropbox.com/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Dropbox Sign, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Oauth Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Dropbox Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Dropbox account:

- Create an account from the [Dropbox Sign](https://sign.dropbox.com/) page.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating a Dropbox App

Follow the steps below to create a Dropbox app:

1. Log in to your [Dropbox Sign Account](https://app.hellosign.com/).
2. Go to **API**.
3. In the Click **Create app**.
4. Enter the following details in the **General Information** section:
    - **Name**: Enter a unique name for your app.
    - **Domain**: Enter the app domain. 
5. In the **Oauth** section, select the **Enable OAuth for this app** checkbox.
6. In the **OAuth Callback** textbox, enter the **Ampersand** redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
7. Select the applicable scopes. 
8. Click **CREATE APPLICATION**.

Once the app is created, you'll find the **Client ID** and **OAuth Secret** keys for your app in the app **Details** section of your app. Note these credentials as they are necessary for connecting your app to Ampersand.


## Add Your Dropbox Sign App Info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create a Dropbox integration.

## Using the connector

To start integrating with Dropbox Sign:
- Create a manifest file like the [example above](#example-integration).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for OAuth authorization.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
