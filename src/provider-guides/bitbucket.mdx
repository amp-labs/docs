### Example integration

For an example manifest file of an Apollo integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/bitbucket/amp.yaml).


## Before You Get Started

To connect Bitbucket with Ampersand, you will need [a Bitbucket/Atlassian Account](https://bitbucket.org/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an OAuth consumer in your bitbucket workspace, configure the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Bitbucket Account

Follow these steps to sign up for a Bitbucket account:

- Go to the [Atlassian website](https://id.atlassian.com/login?application=bitbucket) and sign up for a new account. 

### Register a Bitbucket OAuth App

Follow the steps below to register a Bitbucket OAuth app:

1. Log in to your [Bitbucket account](https://id.atlassian.com/login?application=bitbucket).
2. Go to **Workspace Settings** by clicking the gear icon in the top-right navigation bar.
3. Select **OAuth consumers** from the left sidebar then click **Add consumer**.
4. Enter the following details in the create application form:
   1. **Name**: Enter a name for your app.
   2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of your app.
   3. **Callback URL**: Enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
5. Select the permissions you want to grant to your app.
6. Click **Save**.
