## What's Supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.domain}}/api/{{.agency_slug}}`.
  - To get the **domain**, log in to your Loxo account and check the URL in your browser’s address bar. It usually follows this pattern: `https://[your-domain-here]`.
  - To get the **agency_slug**, go to **Settings > General** under **Workspace**. In the **Agency Info** section, look at the **Resume Forwarding Address** — the part before the @ symbol is the **agency_slug** value.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Loxo, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations: 
  - name: loxo-integration
    displayName: Loxo
    provider: loxo
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses **API Key authentication**, so you do not need to configure a Provider App before getting started. (Provider Apps are only required for providers using the **OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type**.)

To integrate with Loxo:
- Create a manifest file similar to the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component, which will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key provided by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://{{.domain}}/api/{{.agency_slug}}`.

## Creating an API key for Loxo

1. Log in to your [Loxo account](https://app.loxo.co/login). 
2. Navigate to **settings** and click  **API Keys** under **Workspace**.
3. Click **Add** Button.
