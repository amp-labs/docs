## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Read Actions](/read-actions), including full historic backfill. Please note that incremental read uses client-side filtering via the `updatedAt` field since the API doesn't support native time-based filtering.
- [Write Actions](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.supersend.io`.

- [teams](https://docs.supersend.io/docs/team) (Read, Write)

### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a SuperSend integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/superSend/amp.yaml).

## Using the connector

This connector uses **API Key authentication**, so you do not need to configure a Provider App before getting started. (Provider Apps are only required for providers using the **OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type**.)

To integrate with SuperSend:
- Create a manifest file similar to the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component, which will prompt the customer for their API key.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.

## Creating an API key for SuperSend

1. Log in to your [SuperSend account](https://app.supersend.io/).
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **System** tab.
3. Copy your API key from the settings.
