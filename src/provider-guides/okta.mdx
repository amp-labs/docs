## What's supported

## Before you get started

To connect Okta with Ampersand, you will need an [Okta account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an OAuth 2.0 app in Okta and obtain the following credentials:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create an Okta account

Here's how you can sign up for an Okta developer account:

1. Go to the [Okta Developer Sign Up page](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and create an account.
2. Complete the registration process and verify your email.

### Creating an Okta app

Follow the steps below to create an OAuth 2.0 app in Okta:

1. Sign in to your [Okta Admin Console](https://login.okta.com/).
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Create App Integration**.
4. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the sign-in method.
5. Select **Web Application** as the application type and click **Next**.

7. In the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field, enter the Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
8. Click **Save**.

The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed in the **Client Credentials** section. Note these credentials, as you will need them to connect your app to Ampersand.
