## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://payments.sandbox.braintree-api.com/graphql`.

### Example integration

To define an integration for Braintree, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```YAML
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: braintree-integration
    displayName: My Braintree Integration
    provider: braintree
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Before You Get Started

[Click here](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-keys) for detailed information about finding and generating your API credentials (Public Key, Private Key, and Merchant ID) in Braintree.

Note: Make sure you're using the correct environment (Sandbox or Production) credentials.

## Using the connector

This connector uses Basic Auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Braintree:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their API credentials.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/define-integrations/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the correct Basic Auth headers to your requests.

For detailed information about available GraphQL queries and mutations, refer to the [Braintree API Reference](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/graphql/).
