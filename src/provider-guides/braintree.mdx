### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a Braintree integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/braintree/amp.yaml).

## Using the connector

This connector uses **Basic Auth**, so you do not need to configure a Provider App before getting started. (Provider Apps are only required for providers using the **OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type**.)

To integrate with Braintree:
- Create a manifest file similar to the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component, which will prompt the customer for their API credentials.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.

## Getting API credentials for Braintree

1. Log in to your [Braintree Control Panel](https://www.braintreegateway.com/login).
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
3. Generate or view your API credentials (Public Key, Private Key, and Merchant ID).

For more details, see the [Braintree API Credentials documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-keys).

Note: Make sure you're using the correct environment (Sandbox or Production) credentials.
