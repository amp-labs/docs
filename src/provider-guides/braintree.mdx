### Example integration

To define an integration for Braintree, create a manifest file that looks like this:

```yaml
# amp.yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0
integrations:
  - name: braintree-integration
    displayName: My Braintree Integration
    provider: braintree
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: customers
          destination: myWebhook
          schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
        - objectName: transactions
          destination: myWebhook
          schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
    write:
      objects:
        - objectName: customers
    proxy:
      enabled: true
```

## Using the connector

This connector uses **Basic Auth**, so you do not need to configure a Provider App before getting started. (Provider Apps are only required for providers using the **OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type**.)

To integrate with Braintree:
- Create a manifest file similar to the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component, which will prompt the customer for their API credentials.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
