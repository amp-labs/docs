## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:
- [Read Actions](/read-actions), including full historic backfill. Incremental read support varies by object; if incremental read isn’t available for an object, scheduled reads will perform a full refresh for that object.
- [Write Actions](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://{{.workspace}}.myshopify.com`.

### Supported objects

The Shopify connector supports reading from and writing to the following objects:

- [customers](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/customer)
- [orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/order)
- [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/product)

For objects and fields, you can also use Ampersand’s [Object Metadata APIs](/reference/objects-&-fields/get-object-metadata-for-connection) to inspect what’s available for a specific connection.

## Example integration

For an example manifest file of a Shopify integration, visit our [samples repo on GitHub](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/shopify/amp.yaml).

## Before you get started

To connect Shopify with Ampersand, you will need:
- A Shopify Partner account (to create an app): [Shopify Partners](https://partners.shopify.com/)
- A Shopify store to install and test the app. For development and testing, we recommend using a Shopify dev store. See Shopify’s documentation: [Create dev stores](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/dev-dashboard/development-stores).

## Create a Shopify app

Shopify uses OAuth 2.0 (authorization code grant) for apps created in the Partner Dashboard.

For Shopify’s full, up-to-date instructions for creating an app and configuring OAuth, see Shopify’s documentation: [Create an app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/dev-dashboard/create-apps-using-dev-dashboard).

At a high level:

1. Log in to the [Shopify Partners portal](https://partners.shopify.com/) and open **Apps**.

2. Create an app. After the app is created, you’ll land on **Create a version**.

3. Configure the access scopes your integration needs.

4. Configure the OAuth redirect URL:
   - `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`

5. Release the version. Then go to the app’s settings page and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Protected customer data / approvals

Some Shopify scopes and objects (especially those that expose customer data) can require additional approval and compliance steps before Shopify will allow access.

If you see errors like “This app is not approved to access the Customer object”, use the checklist below.

- **Confirm you actually need protected customer data**: only request the minimum scopes and data required for your integration.
- **Complete Shopify’s protected customer data requirements**: follow Shopify’s guidance for requesting access and meeting the required compliance steps: [Work with protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/protected-customer-data).

#### Access to older orders

Shopify may restrict access to older orders unless you request additional scopes (for example, `read_all_orders`). See Shopify’s [Orders API documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/order) for details.

## Add your Shopify app info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).
2. Select the project where you want to create a Shopify integration.

3. Select **Provider apps**.
4. Select _Shopify_ from the **Provider** list.
5. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Shopify app and click **Save changes**.


## Using the connector

To start integrating with Shopify:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/shopify/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer to connect their Shopify store via OAuth.
- If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you’ll start getting webhook messages.
- If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
- If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), start making Proxy API calls. Ampersand will automatically attach the OAuth credentials for the connected store.

## Using the app with third-party Shopify stores

To use your integration with a third-party Shopify merchant (a store you don’t control), the merchant must install and authorize your Shopify app. This installation step is what grants OAuth access for that merchant’s store.

Shopify supports multiple app distribution methods. The one you choose determines whether App Store review is required:

- **Public app (Shopify App Store)**: intended for distribution to many merchants. Requires meeting Shopify’s App Store requirements and passing Shopify review before publishing.
- **Custom distribution**: share an install link directly with specific merchants (without listing publicly). Review requirements differ from public distribution.

For details, see Shopify’s documentation:
- [About app distribution](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/distribution)
- [Select a distribution method](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/distribution/select-distribution-method)

## List on the Shopify App Store (optional)

If you plan to distribute your app publicly (beyond a single merchant/store), you may need to submit it for review and create an App Store listing.

- Review Shopify’s [App Store requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/shopify-app-store/app-store-requirements)
- Follow Shopify’s steps to [submit your app for review](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/app-store-review/submit-app-for-review)
