## Before You Get Started

To integrate GoToWebinar with Ampersand, you need to [Create a GoToWebinar Account](#create-a-GoToWebinar-crm-account) and obtain the following credentials from your GoToWebinar App:

You will then use this credential to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a GoToWebinar Account

You need a **GoToWebinar** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a GoToWebinar account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [GoToWebinar site](https://GoToWebinar.com/) and sign up for a free account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating an OAuth app in GoToWebinar

Once your GoToWebinar account is ready, you need to create an OAuth application to connect with Ampersand. Follow the steps below to create the OAuth app:

1. Log in to Your [GoToWebinar Account](https://app.GoToWebinar.com/login/).

2. Go to **Settings**.

3. On the _Settings_ page, click **Developer** under the **Connect** section.

4. Go to the **OAuth Apps** tab.
