## What's Supported

### Supported Actions

This connector supports:
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.groovehq.com`.

## Before You Get Started

To integrate Groove with Ampersand, you must register a Groove OAuth2 application. To do this, contact support@groovehq.com and provide the following details:

- **Redirect/Callback URL** is an HTTPS endpoint that will handle the secure callback. For an Ampersand integration, use the following callback URL: https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth.
- You can also provide additional callback URLs to be added, but only HTTPS URLs are allowed.

Once your application is registered, you will receive two credentials: **client_id** and **client_secret.** These credentials are required to connect Groove with Ampersand.

## Add Your Groove App Info to Ampersand

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com).

2. Select the project where you want to create a Groove integration.
