### Example integration

For an example manifest file of a Pylon integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/pylon/amp.yaml).

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Pylon:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/pylon/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their API Key.
- Start making [Read Actions](/read-actions), [Write Actions](/write-actions), and [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions). Ampersand will automatically attach the required authentication headers supplied by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.usepylon.com`.
