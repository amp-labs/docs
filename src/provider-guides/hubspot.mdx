For each of these objects, the connector supports standard fields ([list of standard fields](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGc9zT_J9dyGghDxvqeioAva-5Gj7-2DQzKNMrbrPvw/view?usp=sharing)) and custom fields.

The Hubspot connector only supports reading from:

- [lists](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/lists/overview) (note: incremental reads not supported for Lists)
- Users and owners (see below)

#### Reading users and owners

To read users from your customer's HubSpot workspace, enable the `crm.objects.users.read` scope and add `users` as an object in `amp.yaml`:

```YAML
- objectName: users
  destination: defaultWebhook
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: hs_object_id
      mapToName: userId
    - fieldName: hubspot_owner_id
      mapToName: ownerId
    - fieldName: hs_email
      mapToName: emailAddress
```

### Example Integration

For an example manifest file, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/hubspot/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate HubSpot with Ampersand, you'll need to create a HubSpot app and obtain:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

Choose one of the methods below based on your HubSpot account type.

## Creating a HubSpot App

There are three ways to create a HubSpot OAuth app. Choose the method based on your HubSpot account:

### Method 1: Old Developer Portal

<Warning>
  HubSpot will be deprecating this method on Jan 12th 2026. Other methods below
  are preferred.
</Warning>

If your account was created before 2025, you may see the old interface:

1. Log in to your [HubSpot Developer Dashboard](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers)
2. Click **Create an app**
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/a8c2c6f-hubspot1.gif)
3. Enter **Public app name**, click the **Auth** tab, add Redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth` and click "Create app"
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-old-portal-2.gif)
4. Go to the **Scopes** tab and select your required scopes
   <Note>
     These should match the scopes defined in your Ampersand provider app.
   </Note>
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/1b56fb4-hubspot5.gif)
5. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Auth tab
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-old-portal-3.gif)

Jump to [Add App to Ampersand](#add-app-to-ampersand)

### Method 2: Legacy Apps

This is the method for accessing your previously created apps in HubSpot using the old Developers Portal.

<Note>
  **Method 2 vs Method 3**: Method 2 has no install limits but [won't receive
  new HubSpot
  features](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/overview).
  Method 3 gets new features but has [install
  limits](https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/new-marketplace-distribution-app-install-limits).
  For most Ampersand integrations, Method 2 is sufficient.
</Note>

1. Log in to your HubSpot account (requires Super Admin access)
2. Navigate to **Development** → **Legacy apps**
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-new-dev-1.gif)

<Note>
  If you don't see the Development menu, you need Super Admin permissions.
</Note>

3. Click **Create** → Select **Public**

   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-new-create-legacy-app.gif)

4. Enter **Public app name** and go to the **Auth** tab

   Add Redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth` and click "Create app"
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-old-portal-2.gif)

5. Go to the Scopes section, click "Add new scope" and **select your required scopes**
   <Note>
     These should match the scopes defined in your Ampersand provider app.
   </Note>
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/1b56fb4-hubspot5.gif)
6. **Copy your Client ID and Client Secret** from the Auth tab
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-old-portal-3.gif)

Jump to [Add App to Ampersand](#add-app-to-ampersand)

### Method 3: New Project Apps

Use this method if you prefer a CLI-based workflow or need advanced features
like UI extensions. Note that this method has [install
limits](https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/new-marketplace-distribution-app-install-limits)
that may require listing on the HubSpot Marketplace to overcome.

1. **Open** the terminal
2. **Install** the HubSpot CLI: `npm install -g @hubspot/cli`
3. **Authenticate** using `hs account auth` and select open HubSpot to get your key
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-account-auth.png)

   If you already have a personal access key, select "Enter existing personal
   access key" and skip to [Step 7](#create-project).

4. **Select** your account (if prompted)

<Note>
  When you have multiple accounts, you will be prompted to select the account
  where you want to create the app. Make sure to select the correct one.
</Note>
![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-account-select.png)

5. **Create** your Personal Access Key and copy it
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-create-key.gif)

6. **Go back** to terminal, **paste** the key and **hit Enter**
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-paste-key.png)
7. <span id="create-project">Create a project</span>: `hs project create` and
   follow the prompts

- Enter your project name: **your-project-name**
- Choose where to create the project: **your-desired-path**
- Choose what to include in your project: **App**
- Choose how to distribute your application: **Privately** (See [HubSpot's distribution options](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/app-configuration#distribution))
- Choose your authentication type: **OAuth**
- Choose which features to add: **Leave blank (press Enter)**

or use `hs project create --name your-project-name --project-base app --distribution private --auth oauth`

![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-create-project.png)

8. **Configure** OAuth redirect URL and scopes

Open the folder where project was created and edit `src/app/app-hsmeta.json` to add the redirect URL and scopes:

   <Note>
     Scopes should match the ones defined in your Ampersand provider app.
   </Note>
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "oauth",
    "redirectUrls": ["https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth"],
    "scopes": {
      "required": ["crm.objects.contacts.read", "crm.objects.contacts.write"]
    }
  }
}
```

9. **Deploy**: `hs project upload`

- The project does not exist. Would you like to create it?: **Yes**

![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-deploy-project.png)

10. Get App credentials from **Development** → **Projects**

- **Select the project** you just created
- In **Project Components**, find the OAuth App
- Go to the **Auth** tab to find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-get-credentials.gif)

## Add App to Ampersand

After creating your app using any method above:

1. Log in to your [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com)
2. Select your project → **Provider apps**
3. Select **HubSpot** from the Provider list
4. Enter your **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Scopes** and click **Save changes**
