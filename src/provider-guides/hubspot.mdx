## Before You Get Started

To integrate HubSpot with Ampersand, you need to [Create a HubSpot Account](#create-a-hubspot-account) and obtain the following credentials from a HubSpot App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes Requested

### Create a HubSpot Account

You need a **HubSpot** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a HubSpot account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [HubSpot Developer site](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) and sign up for a free developer account.
- Sign up using your preferred  account.
- Verify your email and complete the registration process.

## Creating a HubSpot App

Once your HubSpot Developer account is ready, you need to create a HubSpot application. Learn more about creating a HubSpot application here.

1. Log in to Your [HubSpot Developer Dashboard](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers?_ga=2.135957745.1749898245.1717410216-1887335227.1717410216&_gl=1*757l65*_ga*MTg4NzMzNTIyNy4xNzE3NDEwMjE2*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcxNzQxMDIxNS4xLjEuMTcxNzQxMDg2OS40OS4wLjA.&step=existing_user).
