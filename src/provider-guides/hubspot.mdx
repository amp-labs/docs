- Users and owners, please refer to the section below.

#### Reading users and owners

In Hubspot, users and owners both refer to people that are using the Hubspot workspace. Each user is assigned an owner ID, and this is the ID that is used to identify owners for Deals, Contacts, etc.

If you want to know the users in your customer's Hubspot workspace, then add `users` as an object in `amp.yaml`.

```YAML
        - objectName: users
          destination: defaultWebhook
          schedule: "0 0 * * *" # every day
          requiredFields:
            - fieldName: hs_object_id
              mapToName: userId
            - fieldName: hubspot_owner_id
              mapToName: ownerId
            - fieldName: hs_email
              mapToName: emailAddress
            - fieldName: hs_family_name
              mapToName: lastName
            - fieldName: hs_given_name
              mapToName: firstName
            - fieldName: hs_createdate
              mapToName: createTime
            - fieldName: hs_lastmodifieddate
              mapToName: updateTime
            - fieldName: hs_deactivated
              mapToName: isDeactivated   
```

### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of a Hubspot integration, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/hubspot/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

To integrate HubSpot with Ampersand, you need to [Create a HubSpot Account](#create-a-hubspot-account) and obtain the following credentials from a HubSpot App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes Requested

### Create a HubSpot Account

You need a **HubSpot** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a HubSpot account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [HubSpot Developer site](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) and sign up for a free developer account.
- Sign up using your preferred  account.
- Verify your email and complete the registration process.

## Creating a HubSpot App

Once your HubSpot Developer account is ready, you need to create a HubSpot application. Learn more about creating a HubSpot application here.
