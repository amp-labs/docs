### Supported Objects

The Hubspot connector supports writing to and reading from the following objects:

- [companies](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/companies)
- [contacts](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts)
- [deals](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/deals)
- [emails](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/engagements/email)

For each of these objects, the connector supports standard fields ([list of standard fields](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGc9zT_J9dyGghDxvqeioAva-5Gj7-2DQzKNMrbrPvw/view?usp=sharing)) and custom fields.

The Hubspot connector only supports reading from:

- [lists](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/lists/overview) (note: incremental reads not supported for Lists)
- Users and owners (see below)

#### Reading users and owners

To read users from your customer's HubSpot workspace, enable the `crm.objects.users.read` scope and add `users` as an object in `amp.yaml`:

```YAML
- objectName: users
  destination: defaultWebhook
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  requiredFields:
    - fieldName: hs_object_id
      mapToName: userId
    - fieldName: hubspot_owner_id
      mapToName: ownerId
    - fieldName: hs_email
      mapToName: emailAddress
```

### Example Integration

For an example manifest file, visit our [samples repo on Github](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/hubspot/amp.yaml).

## Before You Get Started

If you don't already have one, sign up for a [free HubSpot developer account](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm?intent=developer).

## Create a HubSpot App

### Method 1: New Project Apps

New Project Apps are [limited to 25 installs](https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/new-marketplace-distribution-app-install-limits), until the app is listed on the HubSpot Marketplace. We recommend starting the process to [publish to HubSpot marketplace](#publish-to-hubspot-marketplace) as soon you've finished building your integration and tested it internally or with a customer.

To create a New Project App:
1. **Open** the terminal
2. **Install** the HubSpot CLI: `npm install -g @hubspot/cli`
3. **Authenticate** using `hs account auth` and select open HubSpot to get your key
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-account-auth.png)

   If you already have a personal access key, select "Enter existing personal
   access key" and skip to [Step 7](#create-project).

4. **Select** your account (if prompted)

<Note>
  If you have multiple accounts, make sure to select the developer account.
</Note>

5. **Create** your Personal Access Key and copy it
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-create-key.gif)

6. **Go back** to terminal, **paste** the key and **hit Enter**
   ![Alt text](/images/provider-guides/hubspot-cli-paste-key.png)
7. <span id="create-project">Create a project</span>:

Copy and paste this command in the terminal:

```
hs project create --name your-project-name --project-base app --distribution marketplace --auth oauth --features
```

8. Configure OAuth redirect URL and scopes

Open the folder where the HubSpot project was created and edit `src/app/app-hsmeta.json`.

Replace the `auth` section of the file with the snippet below. If you wish to read or write to more objects than **contacts**, then add more scopes. For example, if you also want to read **companies**, then you can add the following scopes:
- crm.objects.companies.read

For a full list of HubSpot scopes, please refer to [HubSpot documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/authentication/scopes#list-of-available-scopes).

```json
{
  "auth": {
   "type": "oauth",
   "redirectUrls": ["https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth"],
   "requiredScopes": [
      "oauth",
      "crm.objects.contacts.read",
      "crm.objects.contacts.write"
   ],
   "optionalScopes": [],
   "conditionallyRequiredScopes": []   
  }
}
```

9. **Deploy**: run the following command

```
hs project upload
```

You will be prompted to create the new project, select "yes".

## Using the connector

- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview)
- If using Read or Subscribe Actions, create a [destination](/destinations)
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component
- Start using the connector!

## Customer guide

Share the [HubSpot customer guide](/customer-guides/hubspot) with your customers to help them use your integration.

## Publish to HubSpot Marketplace

When you are ready to list on the HubSpot marketplace, follow the instructions in the [HubSpot documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/list-apps/listing-your-app/listing-your-app).

- For the **App Information** section, you should use information about your company, not about Ampersand.
- For **Install Button URL**, use the URL of your application that users go to to start the installation process (this is usually where you've embedded the Ampersand UI Component).
