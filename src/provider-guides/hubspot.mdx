- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes Requested

### Create a HubSpot Account

You need a **HubSpot** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a HubSpot account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [HubSpot Developer site](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) and sign up for a free developer account.
- Sign up using your preferred  account.
- Verify your email and complete the registration process.

## Creating a HubSpot App

Once your HubSpot Developer account is ready, you need to create a HubSpot application. Learn more about creating a HubSpot application here.
