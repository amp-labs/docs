## Before You Get Started

To connect _Zoho_ with _Ampersand_, you will need [a Zoho Account](https://www.zoho.com/crm/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to configure an app in _Zoho_ and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Zoho Account

Here's how you can sign up for a **Zoho** account:

- Go to the [Zoho Sign Up page](https://www.zoho.com/crm/signup.html) and create an account.

### Creating a Zoho App

Follow the steps below to create a _Zoho_ app and add the Ampersand redirect URL in the app:

1. Log in the [Zoho API Console Account](https://api-console.zoho.com/) using your Zoho account.
2. Click **Get Started** to create your first app. If you have already created an application, click **Add Client** to create a new app.
3. Select **Server-based Applications**.
4. Enter the following details:
   1. **Client Name**: Name of the client app.
   2. **Homepage URL**: The home page URL of the app.
   3. **Authorized Redirect URIs**: The Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`.
5. Click **Create**.

You'll see the details of your newly created application. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys as they are necessary for connecting your app to Ampersand.
