### Example Integration

For an example manifest file of a Zoho Desk integration, visit our [samples repo on GitHub](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/zoho/desk/amp.yaml).


## Before You Get Started

To connect Zoho with Ampersand, you will need an account in an appropriate Zoho product:

- [Zoho CRM Account](https://www.zoho.com/crm/)
- [Zoho Desk Account](https://www.zoho.com/desk/)

Once your account is created, you'll need to configure an app in Zoho and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

You will use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Zoho Account

Go to the particular Zoho product sign-up page and create an account:

- [Zoho CRM Sign Up page](https://www.zoho.com/crm/signup.html)
- [Zoho Desk Sign Up page](https://www.zoho.com/desk/signup.html)

### Creating a Zoho App

Follow the steps below to create a Zoho app and add the Ampersand redirect URL:

1. Log in to the [Zoho API Console Account](https://api-console.zoho.com/) using your Zoho account.
2. Click **Get Started** to create your first app. If you have already created an application, click **Add Client** to create a new app.
3. Select **Server-based Applications**.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Client Name**: Name of the client app
   - **Homepage URL**: The home page URL of your app
   - **Authorized Redirect URIs**: The Ampersand redirect URL: `https://api.withampersand.com/callbacks/v1/oauth`
5. Click **Create**.

You'll see the details of your newly created application. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys as they are necessary for connecting your app to Ampersand.

3. Select **Provider apps**.
4. Select **Zoho** from the **Provider** list.
5. Enter the previously obtained **Client ID** in the **Client ID** field and the **Client Secret** in the **Client Secret** field.
6. In the **Scopes** field, enter the list of desired scopes for your integration. We recommend the following scopes. If you want more granular scopes, please refer to the [Zoho documentation](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/scope.html) for syntax.

**Zoho CRM:**
```
ZohoCRM.modules.ALL
ZohoCRM.settings.ALL
// Additional Scope Required for Subscribe Action

```

**Zoho Desk:**
```

## Customer Guide

The [Zoho Customer Guide](/customer-guides/zoho) can be shared with your customers to help them successfully use your integration.

1. Sign up and create a company profile on the [Zoho Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoho.com/home).
2. Click on the profile icon on the home page and select **Partner Console**.
3. Select **Company Profile** on the left panel.
4. Provide your company details. Note that these are your own company's details, not Ampersand's.
