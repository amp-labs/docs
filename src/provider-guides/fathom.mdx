## What's supported

### Supported actions

This connector supports:

- [Write Actions](/write-actions).
- [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), using the base URL `https://api.fathom.ai`.



### Supported Objects

The Fathom connector supports writing to and reading from the following objects:
- [meetings](https://docs.fathom.ai/api-reference/meetings/list-meetings) (read), 
- [teams](https://docs.fathom.ai/api-reference/teams/list-teams) (read), 
- [team_members](https://docs.fathom.ai/api-reference/team-members/list-team-members) (read)
- [webhooks](https://docs.fathom.ai/api-reference/webhooks/create-webhook) (write)

## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.

To start integrating with Fathom:
- Create a manifest file like the [example](https://github.com/amp-labs/samples/blob/main/fathom/amp.yaml).
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- If you are using Read Actions, create a [destination](/destinations).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for their username and password.
- Start using the connector!
   - If your integration has [Read Actions](/read-actions), you'll start getting webhook messages.
   - If your integration has [Write Actions](/write-actions), you can start making API calls to our Write API.
   - If your integration has [Proxy Actions](/proxy-actions), you can start making Proxy API calls.
