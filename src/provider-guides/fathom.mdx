## Using the connector

This connector uses API Key auth, which means that you do not need to set up a Provider App before getting started. (Provider apps are only required for providers that use OAuth2 Authorization Code grant type.)

To start integrating with Fathom:
- Create a manifest file like the example above.
- Deploy it using the [amp CLI](/cli/overview).
- Embed the [InstallIntegration](/embeddable-ui-components#install-integration) UI component. The UI component will prompt the customer for an API key.
- Start making [Proxy Calls](/proxy-actions), and Ampersand will automatically attach the API key supplied by the customer. Please note that this connector's base URL is `https://api.fathom.ai`.
