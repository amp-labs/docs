# Headless React Library

The Headless React Library provides a powerful foundation for managing connections and installations while giving you complete control over your UI implementation. This library is designed for developers who want to build custom user interfaces while leveraging robust connection management capabilities.

## Overview

The Headless React Library provides a series of react hooks that manage connections, installations, 
and other configuration data with queries and mutation hooks. The hooks may be used together 
or independently from the @amp-labs/react embeddable UI components.

The Headless React Library separates the logic of connection and installation management from the UI components, allowing you to:

- Manage connections to various services and platforms
- Handle installation processes
- Implement custom UI components
- Maintain full control over the user experience

## Installation 
The headless react lib is currently in the same package as our embeddable UI in @amp-labs/react. 

```bash
npm install @amp-labs/react
# or
yarn add @amp-labs/react-
```

## Core Features

### Installation provider
The `InstallationProvider` is a React context provider that provides shared parameters. It wraps your component at the installation level and provides access to installation-related functionality through hooks.

The provider requires the following props:
- `integration`: The name of your integration
- `consumerRef`: A unique identifier for the consumer
- `groupRef`: A unique identifier for the group
- `consumerName`: (Optional) A display name for the consumer
- `groupName`: (Optional) A display name for the group

This provider is essential for using any of the headless hook in your application.

```tsx
import {
  AmpersandProvider,     // needed for any component/hooks in @amp-labs/react
  InstallationProvider,  // provider needed for headless hooks
} from "@amp-labs/react"

// env variables
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_AMP_API_KEY;
const projectId = import.meta.env.VITE_AMP_PROJECT_ID;

const PARAMS = {
  integration,
  provider: "salesforce",
  consumerRef: "consumer-test-1",
  groupRef: "group-test-1",
  integration: "my-salesforce-integration"
};

function App() {
  return (
    // Provider for the Ampersand SDK
    <AmpersandProvider options={{ apiKey: apiKey, projectId: projectId }}>
      {/* Provider for the installation specific headless library */}
      <InstallationProvider
        integration={PARAMS.integration}
        consumerRef={PARAMS.consumerRef}
        groupRef={PARAMS.groupRef}
      >
        {/* Builder Custom Installation Component */}
        <MyComponent />
      </InstallationProvider>
    </AmpersandProvider>
  );
}
```


### Connection Management

The library provides hooks and utilities for managing connections:

The `useConnection` hook provides access to the current connection state and management functions. It returns an object with the following properties:

- `connection`: The current Connection object, or null if not connected
- `error`: Any error that occurred during connection operations
- `isPending`: Boolean indicating if a connection operation is in progress
- `isFetching`: Boolean indicating if connection data is being fetched
- `isError`: Boolean indicating if an error occurred
- `isSuccess`: Boolean indicating if the last operation was successful

This hook is useful for building custom connection management UIs and handling connection states in your application.

```tsx
import { useConnection, ConnectProvider } from '@amp-labs/react';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    connection, // Connection object
    error,
    isPending,
    isFetching,
    isError,
    isSuccess,
  } = useConnection();

  // Use these values to build your custom UI
  return (
    <div>
      {connection ? (
        // embeddable ui component
        <ConnectProvider
            provider={PARAMS.provider}
            consumerRef={PARAMS.consumerRef}
            groupRef={PARAMS.groupRef}
            onConnectSuccess={(connection) => {
              console.log("Connection successful:", connection);
            }}
            onDisconnectSuccess={(connection) => {
              console.log("Disconnection successful:", connection);
            }}
          />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <MyInstallIntegrationComponent/>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Installation Management
The `useInstallation` hook provides access to the current installation state and management functions. It returns an object with the following properties:

- `installation`: The current Installation object, or null if not installed
- `error`: Any error that occurred during installation operations
- `isPending`: Boolean indicating if an installation operation is in progress
- `isFetching`: Boolean indicating if installation data is being fetched
- `isError`: Boolean indicating if an error occurred
- `isSuccess`: Boolean indicating if the last operation was successful

This hook is useful for building custom installation management UIs and handling installation states in your application.

Handle installation processes with the installation hooks:

```tsx
import { useInstallation } from '@amp-labs/react';

function InstallationComponent() {
  const { installation } = useInstallation();

  return (
    <div>
      {installation ? (
       <div>Installation Installed</div>
      ) : (
        <div>Configure Installation</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Installation Management Hooks

The following hooks provide granular control over installation operations:

- `useCreateInstallation`: Creates a new installation with the provided configuration
- `useUpdateInstallation`: Updates an existing installation with new configuration
- `useDeleteInstallation`: Removes an existing installation

These hooks can be used individually or together to build custom installation flows:


## Examples

### Basic App Example
https://github.com/amp-labs/headless-basic-app

#### The Demo App has the following features:
- useConnections: manage when to show `<ConnectProvider/>`
- useManifest	: manage objects and metadata

#### Salesforce integration example
- field mapping interface: map dynamic fields to corresponding Salesforce fields
- connects with Salesforce through `<ConnectProvider/>`
- field metadata from Salesforce to populate available mapping options

####  Installation Management
- Install/Update: Creates or updates the Salesforce integration
- Reset: Syncs back to the server state
- Delete: Removes the installation

#### Installation Config Management
- local config state is managed by the `useConfig` hook
- provides getters and setters to manipulate the config object needed for installation mutations

#### Bring your own UI
Example using Shadcn UI components + Tailwind CSS


### Builder defined flow (no user input needed)
The config is able to be passed in directly if no additional config state management is needed.

```tsx
import {
  AmpersandProvider, ConnectProvider, useConnection, useInstallation,
} from '@amp-labs/react';

import { ConfigContent, AmpersandProviderOptions, InstallationProviderOptions } from '@amp-labs/react/types';

const installationOptions: InstallationProviderOptions = {
  integration: 'my-hubspot-integration',
  consumerRef: 'user-123',
  consumerName: 'User 123',
  groupRef: 'company-456',
  groupName: 'My Organization',
};

const projectOptions: AmpersandProviderOptions ={
  apiKey: 'my-api-key',
  project: 'my-project',
}

export function App() {
  // Wrap your custom component inside of AmpersandProvider and InstallationProvider
  return (
    <AmpersandProvider options={projectOptions}>
      <InstallationProvider options={installationOptions}>
        <MyIntegrationComponent />
      </InstallationProvider>
    </AmpersandProvider>
  );
}

// Static content for the installation, no user input needed
const myConfig: ConfigContent = {
  read: {
    objects: {
      contacts: {
        objectName: 'contacts',
        // Auto-select all fields to be read,
        // alternatively you can specify any desired fields & mappings here.
        selectedFieldsAuto: 'all',
      },
    }
};

function MyIntegrationComponent() {
  const {
    installation,
    isPending: isInstallationPending, // No data yet
    isFetching: isInstallationFetching, // Data is being refreshed
    isError: isInstallationError,
    error: installationError,
  } = useInstallation();
  
  const {
    connection,
    isPending: isConnectionPending, // No data yet
    isFetching: isConnectionFetching, // Data is being refreshed
    isError: isConnectionError,
    error: connectionError,
  } = useConnection(); 

  // Custom connection loading, error, and installation state overrides
  if (isConnectionPending || isInstallationPending) return <div>Loading </div>;
  if (isConnectionError) return <div>Error loading connection: {connectionError.message}</div>;
  if (isInstallationError) return <div>Error loading installation: {installationError.message}</div>;

  // The installation already exists
  if (!!installation) { return (<MyManageInstallationComponent />) } 

  if (connection) {
     createInstallation({ config: myConfig });
  };

  // Use Ampersand's built in UI for the Connection flow
  // This is the same as the existing ConnectProvider component but parameters
  // can be ommited since we are inside of InstallationProvider
  // When the connection is successful, this component will re-render since
  // `useConnection` will return the new connection.
  return (
     <ConnectProvider
        consumerRef={installationOptions.consumerRef}
        groupRef={installationOptions.groupRef}
     />
    </div>
  );
}
```
