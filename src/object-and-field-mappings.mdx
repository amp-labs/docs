title: "Object & field mappings"
---

Ampersand supports builder or consumer mappings for objects, required & optional fields. This allows you to map objects and fields from providers to labels of your choice, or allow your end users to define their own mappings.

## Builder-Defined Mappings

### Object mappings
You can map an object from a provider to a label of your choice. This can help you with any naming/semantic conventions that you need, or even help you build a unified API across different providers.

For example, if you map the `account` object from **Salesforce** and the `contact` object from **HubSpot** to a unified label like `company`, your read action results will be delivered under the object name of `company`. The original object name will still be available in the response's `rawObjectName` key.

If you wish to write data to `company`, you can [inherit the mapping](/define-integrations/write-actions#sharing-mappings-with-read-actions) from the read action.

Here's an example of a hubspot integration that maps the `contacts` object to `people`:
```YAML
  - name: hubspot-integration
    displayName: Hubspot integration
    provider: hubspot
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contacts
          mapToName: people
          # Additional configuration
```

### Field mappings
You can map individual fields to labels of your choosing. This can help you enforce naming conventions, or standardize field names across providers.

For example, you could map a `firstname` field to `firstName` if you want to ensure camel casing. Read results will deliver the field under the `firstName` key, and write actions can use `firstName` to update the original `firstname` (if they inherit the mapping)

```YAML
  - name: read-write-hubspot
    displayName: Read and write hubspot
    provider: hubspot
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contacts
          requiredFields:
            - fieldName: firstname
              mapToName: firstName
```

## Consumer Mappings

Consumer-defined mappings allow your end users (or consumers, in [Ampersand terminology](/terminology)) to define their own objects and field mappings.

### Field-Level Mappings
Your end users may have a custom field to add notes to an Account object. You can ask your consumers to define this mapping at the time of installation, and receive data across different consumers under a single unified field like `notes`.

**Example**:
- You define a `notes` field in your integration.
- **User A** stores notes in `field_a`, while **User B** uses `field_b`.
- The UI library will ask each user to identify which field to map, and Ampersand delivers them under `notes`, accommodating custom fields unique to each consumer.
- You can write back to each user's specific fields by writing to the `notes` field, if you inherit the mapping.

```YAML
  - name: salesforce-integration
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          requiredFields:
            # required fields
          optionalFields:
            # There is no fieldName for consumer mapped fields
            - mapToName: notes
              mapToDisplayName: Account notes
              prompt: Please select the field that contains notes for this account
          # Additional configuration
    write:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          inheritMapping: true
```

If you wish to write to optional consumer mapped fields, Ampersand will automatically strip it from the write request if no mapping exists.
