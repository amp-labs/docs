title: "Object and field mapping"
---

Ampersand supports object mapping and field mapping. This allows you to either pre-define a set of mappings, or prompt your users to define their own mappings via Ampersand's UI components.

## Predefined mapping

### Object mapping

You can map an object from a provider API to a label of your choice. This can help you with any naming/semantic conventions that you need, or even help you build a unified API across different API providers.

For example, if you map the `account` object from **Salesforce** and the `companies` object from **HubSpot** to a unified label like `company`, your read action results will be delivered under the object name of `company`. The original object name will still be available in the response's `rawObjectName` key.

If you wish to write data to `company`, you can [inherit the mapping](/define-integrations/write-actions#sharing-mappings-with-read-actions) from the read action.

Here's an example of a Salesforce integration that maps the `account` object to `company`:

```YAML
  - name: salesforce-integration
    displayName: My Salesforce integration
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          mapToName: company
          # Additional configuration
    write:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          inheritMapping: true
```

### Field mapping

You can map individual fields to labels of your choosing. This can help you enforce naming conventions, or standardize field names across API providers.

For example, you could map a `mobilephone` field to `phone`. Read results will deliver the field under the `phone` key, and when you make a call to the Write API, you can use `phone` to update the original `mobilePhone` field if the write action inherits the mapping.

```YAML
  - name: hubspot-integration
    displayName: My Hubspot integration
    provider: hubspot
    module: crm
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: contacts
          requiredFields:
            - fieldName: mobilephone
              mapToName: phone
    write:
      objects:
        - objectName: contacts
          inheritMapping: true
```

## User-defined mapping

User-defined mappings allow your end users (or consumers, in [Ampersand terminology](/terminology)) to define mappings. Currently, only user-defined field mappings are supported, not object mappings yet.

### Field mapping

Your end users may have a custom field to add notes to an Account object. You can ask your consumers to define this mapping at the time of installation, and receive data across different consumers under a single unified field like `notes`.

**Example**:
- You define a `notes` field in your integration.
- **User A** stores notes in `field_a`, while **User B** uses `field_b`.
- The UI library will ask each user to identify which field to map, and Ampersand delivers them under `notes`, accommodating custom fields unique to each consumer.
- You can write back to each user's specific fields by writing to the `notes` field, if you inherit the mapping.

Field mappings can either be inside `requiredFields` or `optionalFields`, you'll specify:

* **mapToName:** when Ampersand delivers the data from this field to you, this is the name that will be used to identify the field.
* **mapToDisplayName:** the text to display to the user in the UI component when asking them to select a field.
* **default** (optional): the default field, you should only use standard fields as defaults.
* **prompt** (optional): additional context that you want to show your user in the UI Component about this field, in a tooltip.

```YAML
  - name: salesforce-integration
    provider: salesforce
    read:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          optionalFields:
            # There is no fieldName for user-mapped fields
            - mapToName: notes
              mapToDisplayName: Account notes
              prompt: Please select the field that contains notes for this account
          # Additional configuration
    write:
      objects:
        - objectName: account
          inheritMapping: true
```

If you have an optional field mapping, and the user chose not to map the field (because they do not have a field that corresponds to notes), you can still make Write API calls with `notes` populated, and Ampersand will automatically strip it from the request before writing to the provider API to prevent errors.
