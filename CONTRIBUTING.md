# Docs style guide

## Use sentence case for headings

Headings should be "Sentence case", not "Title Case". This means that you should only capitalize the first letter.

## Use second person

Use "you" instead of "we" or "us". For example: "You can create a destination in the Ampersand Dashboard", instead of "Let us create a destination in the Ampersand dashboard".
