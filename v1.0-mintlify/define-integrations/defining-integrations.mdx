To start defining integrations with Ampersand, create a new directory (we recommend calling it `amp`), which will hold your `amp.yaml` file. All your integrations should be defined in the same `amp.yaml` file.

```YAML
amp/
  amp.yaml
```

The high-level keys of `amp.yaml` are the following:

* **specVersion:** the version of the amp.yaml spec used, the current version is `1.0.0`
* **integrations:** the list of integrations that your users can install

The high-level keys of an integration are:

* **name:** the name of the integration, only alphanumeric characters and dashes are allowed.
* **provider:** the API that this integration connects to.
* each integration can include:  
   * [Read Actions](/define-integrations/read-actions)  
   * [Write Actions](/define-integrations/write-actions)  
   * [Subscribe Actions](/define-integrations/subscribe-actions)

Putting all of this together, the basic structure of an `amp.yaml` file looks like the following:



```yaml yaml
specVersion: 1.0.0

integrations: 
-name: readSalesforceAccounts
 provider: salesforce
 read:
   ...
 write:
   ...
 subscribe:
   ...
```
