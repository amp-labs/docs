## Before You Get Started

To integrate Dropbox with Ampersand, you will need a [Dropbox Account](https://www.dropbox.com/register).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Dropbox, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- App Key
- App Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Dropbox Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Dropbox account:

- Go to the [Dropbox Sign Up page](https://www.dropbox.com/register) and create an account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.
