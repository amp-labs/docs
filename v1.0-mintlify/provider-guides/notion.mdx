## Before You Get Started

To integrate Notion with Ampersand, you will need [a Notion Account](https://www.notion.so/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an integration in Notion, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the integration, and obtain the following credentials from your integration:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret

You will then use this token to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Notion Account

- Go to the [Notion Sign Up page](https://www.notion.so/signup).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
