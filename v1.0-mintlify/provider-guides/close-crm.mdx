## Before You Get Started

To integrate Close CRM with Ampersand, you need to [Create a Close CRM Account](https://close.com/) and obtain the following credentials from your Close CRM App:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use this credential to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Close CRM Account

You need a **Close CRM** account to connect with Ampersand. If you do not have a Close CRM account, here's how you can sign up:

- Go to the [Close CRM site](https://close.com/) and sign up for a free account.
- Sign up using your preferred method.

### Creating an OAuth app in Close CRM

Once your Close CRM account is ready, you need to create an OAuth application to connect with Ampersand. Follow the steps below to create the OAuth app:

1. Log in to Your [Close CRM Account](https://app.close.com/login/).

2. Go to **Settings**.

3. On the _Settings_ page, click **Developer** under the **Connect** section.

4. Go to the **OAuth Apps** tab.

5. Click the **Create App** button.

6. Enter the following details in the **Create OAuth App** form:

7. Click **Create**.

You'll find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys in your OAuth app details. These credentials are required for connecting your app to Ampersand, so be sure to note them carefully.
