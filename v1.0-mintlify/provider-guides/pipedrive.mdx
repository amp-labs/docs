## Before You Get Started

To integrate Pipedrive with Ampersand, you will need [a Pipedrive Account](https://www.pipedrive.com/signup).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Pipedrive, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Pipedrive Account

- Go to the [Pipedrive Sign Up page](https://www.pipedrive.com/signup).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
