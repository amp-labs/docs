## Before You Get Started

To integrate Box with Ampersand, you will need [a Box Account](https://account.box.com/signup/).

Once your account is created, you'll need to create an app in Box, configure the Ampersand redirect URI within the app, and obtain the following credentials from your app:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

You will then use these credentials to connect your application to Ampersand.

### Create a Box Account

Here's how you can sign up for a Box account:

- Go to the [Box Sign Up page](https://account.box.com/signup/).
- Sign up using your preferred method.
