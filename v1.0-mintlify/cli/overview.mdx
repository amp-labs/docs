title: Overview and Installation
---

The `amp` Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to deploy integrations and interact with the Ampersand platform. 

## Installation

### Using Homebrew

```
brew tap amp-labs/cli
brew update
brew install amp-labs/cli/cli
```

### Other systems

Visit [https://github.com/amp-labs/cli/releases](https://github.com/amp-labs/cli/releases) and download the binary for your machineâ€™s architecture. Place the binary file somewhere on your PATH (e.g. inside `/usr/bin`).

## Using the CLI

### Log into your Ampersand account

Before using the CLI, you must have an Ampersand account that you've created on the [Ampersand dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/sign-up).

Once your account has been created, you can log into the CLI by running:

```
amp login
```

If you wish to log out, you can run:

```
amp logout
```

### Deploy integrations

After defining your integrations in `amp.yaml`, deploy your changes by running the commands below:

```
amp login
amp deploy <folder_with_amp.yaml> --project=<id-or-name>
```

### View all commands

To see a list of all available commands and global flags, run:

```
amp help
```

### Run in CI/CD

If you are running the Ampersand CLI in a CI/CD system, such as Github Actions, you can:

1. Generate an API key in the [Ampersand Dashboard](https://dashboard.withampersand.com/projects/_/api-keys/new).
2. Use the `key` flag, for example:

```
amp list:integrations --key=<api-key> --project=<id-or-name>
```

Alternatively, you can put the API key in the AMP_API_KEY environment variable, and omit the `key` flag.

```
export AMP_API_KEY=<api-key>
amp list:integrations --project=<id-or-name>
```

### Run in debug mode

You can run any command with the `debug` flag, which will print more verbose output. For example:

```
amp login --debug
```
