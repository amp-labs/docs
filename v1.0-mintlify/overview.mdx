[Ampersand](https://www.withampersand.com/) is a config-first platform for SaaS builders who are creating user-facing integrations. We allow you to:

* Read data from your customer's SaaS
* Write data to your customer's SaaS
* Coming soon: subscribe to events (creates, deletes, and field changes) in your customer's SaaS

Here's an overview of the Ampersand platform:

The key components include:

* **Manifest file:** an `amp.yaml` file, where you define all your integrations: API to connect to, objects and fields you want to read or write, and configuration options you'd like to expose to your customers.
* **Ampersand integration service:** we offer a managed service that keeps track of each of your customer’s configurations, and makes the appropriate API calls to your customer's SaaS, while optimizing for cost, handling retries and error message parsing.

<Note>
**On the roadmap**
 
 Self-hosted version of the the Ampersand Integration Service.

* **Embeddable UIs:** with Ampersand, you can embed set-up, configuration, and management UIs that allow your end users to customize and manage their integrations.

* **Management Console**: our dashboard allows you to monitor and troubleshoot your customers' integrations, and is a place for your customer-facing teams to set up and manage end-user configurations if you want to offer white-glove onboarding and support experiences.
